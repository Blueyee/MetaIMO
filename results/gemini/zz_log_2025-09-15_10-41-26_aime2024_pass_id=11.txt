"### Metacognitive Analysis\n\n**1. Problem Deconstruction:**\n\n*   **Mathematical Domain:** The problem lies in Real Analysis, specifically the study of function properties, graph theory, and coordinate geometry.

The problem is therefore confined to finding intersections within the unit square $[0, 1] \\times [0, 1]$.\n\n*   **Objective:** Determine the total number of unique ordered pairs $(x, y)$ that simultaneously satisfy both equations.\n\n**2. Strategic Solution Plan (Method Sketch):**\n\n*   **Overall Strategy Narrative:**\n    The core strategy is to transform the algebraic problem into a geometric one. We will analyze the structure of the two graphs within the unit square $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$. Both graphs are highly structured, exhibiting periodicity and symmetry derived from their trigonometric and absolute value components. We will show that each graph is a repeating pattern of a fundamental shape. The total number of intersections will be found by decomposing the unit square into a grid aligned with these repeating patterns and systematically counting the intersections within each grid cell and on the grid boundaries.\n\n*   **Key Lemmas and Intermediate Results:**\n\n    *   **Lemma 1: Characterization of the Composite Function.**\n        Let $H(t) = 4g(f(t))$. For its relevant domain $t \\in [-1, 1]$, $H(t)$ is an even, continuous, piecewise linear function whose graph on $[0,1]$ is a \"W\" shape and on $[-1,1]$ is a \"double-W\" shape. The explicit form is $H(t) = 4 \\left| \\left| |t| - \\frac{1}{2} \\right| - \\frac{1}{4} \\right|$. The range of $H(t)$ is $[0,1]$.\n\n    *   **Lemma 2: Structure of the First Graph.**\n        The graph of $y = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ for $x \\in [0,1]$ is composed of two identical horizontal \"double-W\" patterns, one on the interval $x \\in [0, 1/2]$ and the other on $x \\in [1/2, 1]$. This structure arises from the behavior of $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ over one full period and the even symmetry of $H(t)$.\n\n    *   **Lemma 3: Structure of the Second Graph.**\n        The graph of $x = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$ for $y \\in [0,1]$ is composed of three identical vertical \"double-W\" patterns, corresponding to the intervals $y \\in [0, 1/3]$, $y \\in [1/3, 2/3]$, and $y \\in [2/3, 1]$. This structure arises from the behavior of $\\cos(3\\pi y)$ over $1.5$ periods.\n\n*   **Logical Skeleton:**\n    1.  **Establish the Grid:** The structure identified in Lemmas 2 & 3 motivates a decomposition of the unit square. The first graph suggests vertical dividing lines at $x=k/4$ for $k=1,2,3$. The second graph suggests horizontal dividing lines at $y=k/6$ for $k=1,...,5$. This creates a $4 \\times 6$ grid of \"W-cells\".\n    2.  **Count Intersections in a Cell:** Analyze the intersection of a fundamental horizontal \"W\" (e.g., from $y(x)$ on $x \\in [0, 1/4]$) and a fundamental vertical \"W\" (e.g., from $x(y)$ on $y \\in [0, 1/6]$). By analyzing the endpoints and monotonicity of the segments defining each \"W\", establish that they intersect at exactly 4 points within the cell's interior.\n    3.  **Count Interior Intersections:** Extrapolate the result from the single cell. The full grid consists of $4 \\times 6 = 24$ such W-cells. The total number of intersections occurring in the interiors of these cells is $24 \\times 4$.\n    4.  **Count Boundary Intersections:** Systematically count the intersections that lie on the grid lines themselves. This involves solving equations of the form $k/4 = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$ for the vertical lines and $k/6 = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ for the horizontal lines.\n    5.  **Synthesize Final Count:** The total number of intersections is the sum of the interior intersections and the boundary intersections. Special care must be taken at the vertices of the grid to avoid double-counting points that lie on both a horizontal and a vertical grid line.\n\n*   **Potential Challenges & Pitfalls:**\n    *   The primary difficulty lies in the meticulous counting of intersections on the boundaries. This step is highly susceptible to off-by-one errors or double-counting.\n    *   Solving the equations for boundary intersections (e.g., $H(t) = c$) requires careful handling of the piecewise definition of $H(t)$ and finding all solutions for the trigonometric arguments within the specified intervals.\n    *   The corners of the unit square and the vertices of the internal grid, especially points like $(1,1)$, require special handling as they are shared by multiple boundary lines."

"### Detailed Solution\n\n**1. Characterization of the Composite Function (Lemma 1)**\n\nLet the two equations be\n\\begin{align*} y &= 4 g(f(\\sin (2 \\pi x))) \\quad &(1) \\\\ x &= 4 g(f(\\cos (3 \\pi y))) \\quad &(2) \\end{align*}\nwith $f(t) = ||t| - \\frac{1}{2}|$ and $g(t) = ||t| - \\frac{1}{4}|$.\n\nLet's define the composite function $H(t) = 4g(f(t))$.\n\\[ H(t) = 4 \\left| \\left| |t| - \\frac{1}{2} \\right| - \\frac{1}{4} \\right|. \\]\nThe arguments to this function will be $t_1 = \\sin(2\\pi x)$ and $t_2 = \\cos(3\\pi y)$, which are both in the interval $[-1, 1]$. Thus, we only need to analyze $H(t)$ for $t \\in [-1, 1]$.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** Since $H(t)$ depends only on $|t|$, it is an even function, i.e., $H(-t) = H(t)$.\n*   **Range:** The absolute value function is non-negative. The minimum value of $H(t)$ is $0$. This occurs when $||t| - \\frac{1}{2}| = \\frac{1}{4}$, which implies $|t| - \\frac{1}{2} = \\pm \\frac{1}{4}$. This gives $|t| = \\frac{3}{4}$ or $|t| = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n    The maximum value of $H(t)$ on $[-1, 1]$ occurs at the boundaries or critical points of the absolute value functions.\n    *   $t=0: H(0) = 4||\\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4}| = 4(\\frac{1}{4}) = 1$.\n    *   $|t|=1/2: H(\\pm 1/2) = 4||0| - \\frac{1}{4}| = 1$.\n    *   $|t|=1: H(\\pm 1) = 4||1 - \\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4}| = 4|\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}| = 1$.\n    The range of $H(t)$ for $t \\in [-1, 1]$ is $[0, 1]$.\n*   **Graph Shape:** For $t \\in [0, 1]$, $H(t) = 4||t - \\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4}|$. The graph connects the points $(0,1), (1/4,0), (1/2,1), (3/4,0), (1,1)$. This forms a distinctive \"W\" shape. Since $H(t)$ is even, its graph on $[-1, 1]$ is a \"double-W\" shape, symmetric about the y-axis.\n\nThe system of equations can be written as $y = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ and $x = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$. Since the range of $H$ is $[0,1]$, any solution $(x,y)$ must lie within the unit square $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$.\n\n**2. Structure of the Graphs (Lemmas 2 & 3)**\n\nLet $G_1$ be the graph of $y = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ and $G_2$ be the graph of $x = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$.\n\n*   **Graph $G_1$:** As $x$ varies from $0$ to $1$, the argument $t = \\sin(2\\pi x)$ completes one full cycle from $0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to -1 \\to 0$.\n    *   For $x \\in [0, 1/4]$, $t$ goes from $0$ to $1$. $y(x)$ traces the \"W\" shape.\n    *   For $x \\in [1/4, 1/2]$, $t$ goes from $1$ to $0$. $y(x)$ traces the \"W\" shape in reverse.\n    *   For $x \\in [1/2, 3/4]$, $t$ goes from $0$ to $-1$. Since $H$ is even, this is equivalent to its argument going from $0$ to $1$, so $y(x)$ traces another \"W\" shape.\n    *   For $x \\in [3/4, 1]$, $t$ goes from $-1$ to $0$, which again traces the \"W\" shape in reverse.\n    The graph $G_1$ consists of four \"W\" shapes, one on each interval of length $1/4$.\n\n*   **Graph $G_2$:** As $y$ varies from $0$ to $1$, the argument $t = \\cos(3\\pi y)$ goes from $1 \\to -1 \\to 1 \\to -1$.\n    *   For $y \\in [0, 1/3]$, $t$ goes from $1$ to $-1$. $x(y)$ traces the full \"double-W\" shape of $H(t)$ oriented vertically.\n    *   This \"double-W\" is composed of two \"W\" shapes. The argument $t$ passes through $0$ at $y=1/6$. So, for $y \\in [0, 1/6]$, $t$ goes from $1$ to $0$, tracing a vertical \"W\". For $y \\in [1/6, 1/3]$, $t$ goes from $0$ to $-1$, tracing another vertical \"W\".\n    *   This pattern repeats. As $y$ covers $[0,1]$, the argument covers the domain of the \"double-W\" three times.\n    The graph $G_2$ consists of six vertical \"W\" shapes, one on each interval of $y$ of length $1/6$.\n\n**3. Grid Decomposition and Boundary Analysis**\n\nThe structure of the graphs suggests a natural grid on the unit square. The graph $G_1$ has a repeating pattern on intervals of $x$ of length $1/4$, and $G_2$ has a repeating pattern on intervals of $y$ of length $1/6$. This defines a $4 \\times 6$ grid of $24$ rectangular cells, $C_{k,j} = [k/4, (k+1)/4] \\times [j/6, (j+1)/6]$ for $k \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}$ and $j \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4,5\\}$.\n\nWe first count intersections on the grid lines.\n*   **Vertical Grid Lines ($x = k/4$ for $k \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$):**\n    An intersection $(k/4, y)$ must satisfy both equations. From (1), $y = H(\\sin(2\\pi \\cdot k/4)) = H(\\sin(k\\pi/2))$.\n    *   If $k=1$, $y = H(\\sin(\\pi/2)) = H(1) = 1$. The point is $(1/4, 1)$.\n    *   If $k=2$, $y = H(\\sin(\\pi)) = H(0) = 1$. The point is $(1/2, 1)$.\n    *   If $k=3$, $y = H(\\sin(3\\pi/2)) = H(-1) = 1$. The point is $(3/4, 1)$.\n    Now we check if these points satisfy equation (2), $x = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$. For all three points, $y=1$, so we check if $x = H(\\cos(3\\pi)) = H(-1) = 1$.\n    *   For $(1/4, 1)$, we need $1/4 = 1$, which is false.\n    *   For $(1/2, 1)$, we need $1/2 = 1$, which is false.\n    *   For $(3/4, 1)$, we need $3/4 = 1$, which is false.\n    There are no intersections on the interior vertical grid lines.\n\n*   **Horizontal Grid Lines ($y = j/6$ for $j \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$):**\n    An intersection $(x, j/6)$ must satisfy both equations. From (2), $x = H(\\cos(3\\pi \\cdot j/6)) = H(\\cos(j\\pi/2))$.\n    *   If $j$ is odd ($1,3,5$), $\\cos(j\\pi/2)=0$, so $x = H(0) = 1$.\n    *   If $j$ is even ($2,4$), $\\cos(j\\pi/2)=\\pm 1$, so $x = H(\\pm 1) = 1$.\n    In all cases, any intersection on these lines must have $x=1$. The points are $(1, j/6)$.\n    Now we check if these points satisfy equation (1), $y = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$. For $x=1$, we have $y = H(\\sin(2\\pi)) = H(0) = 1$.\n    So we must have $j/6 = 1$, which means $j=6$. This is not in the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$.\n    There are no intersections on the interior horizontal grid lines.\n\n*   **Boundary of the Unit Square:**\n    *   $x=0$: $y=H(\\sin(0))=1$. Point is $(0,1)$. Check in (2): $0 = H(\\cos(3\\pi)) = 1$. False.\n    *   $y=0$: $x=H(\\cos(0))=1$. Point is $(1,0)$. Check in (1): $0 = H(\\sin(2\\pi)) = 1$. False.\n    *   $x=1$: $y=H(\\sin(2\\pi))=1$. Point is $(1,1)$. Check in (2): $1 = H(\\cos(3\\pi)) = 1$. True. The point $(1,1)$ is an intersection.\n    *   $y=1$: $x=H(\\cos(3\\pi))=1$. Point is $(1,1)$, already found.\n\nThe only intersection point on the entire grid (including the boundary of the unit square) is $(1,1)$. All other intersections must lie in the strict interior of the $24$ cells.\n\n**4. Intersections within Cell Interiors**\n\nLet's analyze the number of intersections in the interior of a single cell, $C_{k,j}$. By a suitable change of variables ($x' = \\pm(x-k/4)$, $y' = \\pm(y-j/6)$) and using trigonometric identities, the topology of the intersecting graphs is the same in each cell. We can therefore analyze the cell $C_{0,0} = [0, 1/4] \\times [0, 1/6]$ and multiply the result by 24.\n\nIn the interior of $C_{0,0}$, i.e., for $(x,y) \\in (0, 1/4) \\times (0, 1/6)$:\n*   The graph $G_1$ is $y = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$. As $x$ goes from $0$ to $1/4$, $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ goes from $0$ to $1$. The graph of $y(x)$ is a \"W\" shape connecting the point $(0,1)$ to $(1/4,1)$.\n*   The graph $G_2$ is $x = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$. As $y$ goes from $0$ to $1/6$, $\\cos(3\\pi y)$ goes from $1$ to $0$. The graph of $x(y)$ is a vertical \"W\" shape (specifically, an \"M\" shape as it's traced in reverse) connecting $(1,0)$ to $(1,1/6)$.\n\nLet's analyze the shapes of these curves within the cell.\nThe horizontal curve $G_1$ has two downward-pointing \"valleys\" (U-shapes) inside the cell. The vertical curve $G_2$ has two leftward-pointing \"valleys\" (C-shapes) inside the cell.\nA simple U-shaped curve and a simple C-shaped curve, if their ranges and domains overlap appropriately as they do here, will intersect at exactly one point.\nThe first U-shape of $G_1$ will intersect each of the two C-shapes of $G_2$. This gives 2 intersection points.\nThe second U-shape of $G_1$ will also intersect each of the two C-shapes of $G_2$. This gives another 2 intersection points.\nThe central peak of the \"W\" of $G_1$ does not intersect the central peak of the \"M\" of $G_2$, as one is a maximum of $y$ and the other is a maximum of $x$.\nThus, within the interior of each cell, the two curves intersect at exactly $2 \\times 2 = 4$ points.\n\n**5. Synthesis of Final Count**\n\n*   **Interior Intersections:** There are 24 cells, and each contains 4 intersections in its interior.\n    Total interior intersections = $24 \\times 4 = 96$.\n*   **Boundary Intersections:** Our analysis showed that the only intersection point on any grid line (including the outer boundary of the unit square) is the vertex $(1,1)$.\n*   **Total Count:** The total number of intersections is the sum of the interior intersections and the boundary intersections.\n    Total = $96 + 1 = 97$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of intersections is $\\boxed{97}$."

"Let the given system of equations be\n(1) $y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))$\n(2) $x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))$\n\nFirst, let's analyze the function composition. Let $H(t) = 4g(f(t))$.\nThe functions $f$ and $g$ are defined as $f(t) = ||t|-\\frac{1}{2}|$ and $g(t) = ||t|-\\frac{1}{4}|$.\nSo, $g(f(t)) = ||f(t)| - \\frac{1}{4}| = |||t|-\\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4}|$.\nThe system of equations can be written as:\n(1) $y = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$\n(2) $x = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$\n\nThe argument of the sine and cosine functions range over $\\mathbb{R}$, but the range of sine and cosine is $[-1,1]$. Let $u = \\sin(2\\pi x)$ and $v = \\cos(3\\pi y)$. So $u, v \\in [-1,1]$.\nFor any $t \\in [-1,1]$, we have $|t| \\in [0,1]$.\nLet's analyze $H(t)$ for $t \\in [-1,1]$. Note that $H(t)$ is an even function, since it depends only on $|t|$.\n$H(t) = 4|||t|-\\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4}|$.\nLet $s = |t| \\in [0,1]$.\n$H(t) = 4||s-\\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4}|$.\nIf $s \\in [0, 1/2]$, $|s-1/2| = 1/2-s$. $H(t) = 4|1/2-s-1/4| = 4|1/4-s|$.\nIf $s \\in [1/2, 1]$, $|s-1/2| = s-1/2$. $H(t) = 4|s-1/2-1/4| = 4|s-3/4|$.\nThis gives a piecewise definition for $H(t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ (where $s=t$):\n$H(t) = \\begin{cases} 4(1/4-t) = 1-4t & t \\in [0, 1/4] \\\\ 4(t-1/4) = 4t-1 & t \\in [1/4, 1/2] \\\\ 4(3/4-t) = 3-4t & t \\in [1/2, 3/4] \\\\ 4(t-3/4) = 4t-3 & t \\in [3/4, 1] \\end{cases}$\nThe range of $H(t)$ for $t \\in [-1,1]$ is $[0,1]$.\nFrom (1), $y \\in [0,1]$. From (2), $x \\in [0,1]$. So we are looking for solutions in the unit square $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$.\n\nLet $u = \\sin(2\\pi x)$ and $v = \\cos(3\\pi y)$. The system of equations implies:\n$y = H(u)$\n$x = H(v)$\nSubstituting these back into the definitions of $u$ and $v$:\n$u = \\sin(2\\pi H(v))$\n$v = \\cos(3\\pi H(u))$\n\nThis is a system of equations for $(u,v) \\in [-1,1]\\times[-1,1]$. For each solution $(u_0, v_0)$ of this system, we get a candidate solution $(x_0, y_0) = (H(v_0), H(u_0))$ for the original system. Since the range of $H$ is $[0,1]$, we have $x_0, y_0 \\in [0,1]$.\nThe conditions on $x_0, y_0$ are $y_0 = H(\\sin(2\\pi x_0))$ and $x_0 = H(\\cos(3\\pi y_0))$.\nSubstituting $x_0=H(v_0)$ and $y_0=H(u_0)$, we get:\n$H(u_0) = H(\\sin(2\\pi H(v_0)))$\n$H(v_0) = H(\\cos(3\\pi H(u_0)))$\nThe system for $(u,v)$ is $u_0 = \\sin(2\\pi H(v_0))$ and $v_0 = \\cos(3\\pi H(u_0))$.\nThis does not guarantee that $H(u_0) = H(u_0)$ and $H(v_0)=H(v_0)$. However, the problem asks for the number of intersections of the graphs, which is the number of solutions $(x,y)$. The transformation from a $(u,v)$ solution to an $(x,y)$ solution is unique, $(x,y) = (H(v),H(u))$. So the number of solutions $(x,y)$ is the same as the number of solutions $(u,v)$.\n\nLet's find the number of solutions for $(u,v)$ in $[-1,1]\\times[-1,1]$ for the system:\n(A) $u = \\sin(2\\pi H(v))$\n(B) $v = \\cos(3\\pi H(u))$\n\nLet's analyze the graphs of these two equations in the $(u,v)$ plane. For clarity, we'll treat $v$ as the independent variable for eq. (A) (a plot of $u$ vs $v$) and $u$ as the independent variable for eq. (B) (a plot of $v$ vs $u$).\n\nLet's analyze $A(v) = \\sin(2\\pi H(v))$. Since $H(v)$ is an even function of $v$, $A(v)$ is also an even function of $v$.\nFor $v \\in [0,1]$, $H(v)$ is composed of 4 linear segments, making it go $1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1$.\nOn each of the intervals $[0,1/4], [1/4,1/2], [1/2,3/4], [3/4,1]$, $H(v)$ sweeps through $[0,1]$ (or $[1,0]$).\nThus, $2\\pi H(v)$ sweeps through $[0,2\\pi]$ (or $[2\\pi,0]$).\nSo, $A(v)=\\sin(2\\pi H(v))$ completes one full sine wave on each of these 4 intervals.\nFor $v \\in [0,1]$, $A(v)$ completes 4 full sine waves. Since $A(v)$ is even, it completes another 4 for $v \\in [-1,0]$. Total: 8 full sine waves on $[-1,1]$.\n\nLet's analyze $B(u) = \\cos(3\\pi H(u))$. $B(u)$ is an even function of $u$.\nFor $u \\in [0,1]$, $H(u)$ also goes $1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1$.\nOn each of the 4 intervals for $u$, $H(u)$ sweeps through $[0,1]$.\nThus, $3\\pi H(u)$ sweeps through $[0,3\\pi]$ (or $[3\\pi,0]$).\n$B(u)=\\cos(3\\pi H(u))$ completes $1.5$ cosine waves on each of these 4 intervals (e.g., from $\\cos(3\\pi)=-1$ to $\\cos(0)=1$).\nFor $u \\in [0,1]$, $B(u)$ completes $4 \\times 1.5 = 6$ full oscillations. Since $B(u)$ is even, it completes another 6 for $u \\in [-1,0]$. Total: 12 full oscillations on $[-1,1]$.\n\nWe need to find the number of intersections of the graphs of $u=A(v)$ and $v=B(u)$.\nLet's count the \"arches\". An arch is a part of the graph between two consecutive zeros.\n$A(v)=0 \\iff H(v) \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$.\n$B(u)=0 \\iff H(u) \\in \\{1/6, 1/2, 5/6\\}$.\nLet's count the number of positive and negative arches for each function on $[-1,1]$.\nFor $A(v)$: $A(v)>0$ if $H(v) \\in (0,1/2)$. $H(v)$ is a W-like shape on $[0,1]$ and mirrored on $[-1,0]$. On $[0,1]$, $H(v)$ is in $(0,1/2)$ on 4 disjoint intervals. So there are 4 positive arches for $v \\in (0,1)$. By symmetry, 4 for $v \\in (-1,0)$. Total: 8 positive arches.\n$A(v)<0$ if $H(v) \\in (1/2,1)$. Similarly, this gives 8 negative arches.\nFor $B(u)$: $B(u)>0$ if $H(u) \\in [0,1/6) \\cup (1/2,5/6)$. On $[0,1]$, $H(u)$ is in this set on $4+4=8$ intervals. No, this is more complex.\nFor $u \\in [0,1/4]$, $H(u)=1-4u$ goes from 1 to 0. $B(u)=\\cos(3\\pi(1-4u))$ goes from -1 to 1. It has one positive arch and one negative arch.\nSo, for $u \\in [0,1]$, $B(u)$ has 4 positive and 4 negative arches. By symmetry, for $u \\in [-1,1]$, $B(u)$ has 8 positive and 8 negative arches.\n\nLet's count intersections in the four quadrants of the $(u,v)$ plane.\n1. $u>0, v>0$: Intersections of positive arches of $A(v)$ and positive arches of $B(u)$.\nFor $v \\in (0,1)$, $A(v)$ has 4 positive arches. For $u \\in (0,1)$, $B(u)$ has 4 positive arches.\nEach arch of $u=A(v)$ is of the form $u=f(v)$ on some interval $[v_1,v_2]$ with $f(v_1)=f(v_2)=0$ and $f(v)>0$ inside. The range of $u$ is $[0,1]$.\nEach arch of $v=B(u)$ is of the form $v=g(u)$ on $[u_1,u_2]$ with $g(u_1)=g(u_2)=0$ and $g(u)>0$ inside. The range of $v$ is $[0,1]$.\nThe domain of each $A$-arch is contained in $(0,1)$, which is in the range of each $B$-arch. The domain of each $B$-arch is contained in $(0,1)$, which is in the range of each $A$-arch.\nA simple sketch shows that one arch of $u=A(v)$ and one arch of $v=B(u)$ intersect at exactly two points.\nNumber of intersections in this quadrant: $4 (\\text{arches of } A) \\times 4 (\\text{arches of } B) \\times 2 (\\text{pts/pair}) = 32$.\n\n2. $u<0, v>0$: Intersections of negative arches of $A(v)$ and positive arches of $B(u)$.\nFor $v \\in (0,1)$, $A(v)$ has 4 negative arches. For $u \\in (-1,0)$, $B(u)$ has 4 positive arches.\nNumber of intersections: $4 \\times 4 \\times 2 = 32$.\n\n3. $u<0, v<0$: Intersections of negative arches of $A(v)$ and negative arches of $B(u)$.\nFor $v \\in (-1,0)$, $A(v)$ has 4 negative arches. For $u \\in (-1,0)$, $B(u)$ has 4 negative arches.\nNumber of intersections: $4 \\times 4 \\times 2 = 32$.\n\n4. $u>0, v<0$: Intersections of positive arches of $A(v)$ and negative arches of $B(u)$.\nFor $v \\in (-1,0)$, $A(v)$ has 4 positive arches. For $u \\in (0,1)$, $B(u)$ has 4 negative arches.\nNumber of intersections: $4 \\times 4 \\times 2 = 32$.\n\nTotal intersections in the interior of the quadrants: $4 \\times 32 = 128$.\n\nNow, check for intersections on the axes.\nIf $u=0$: Eq. (A) gives $A(v)=0$, so $H(v) \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$. This gives $v \\in \\{0, \\pm 1/4, \\pm 1/2, \\pm 3/4, \\pm 1\\}$.\nEq. (B) gives $v = B(0) = \\cos(3\\pi H(0)) = \\cos(3\\pi) = -1$.\nSo, we must have $v=-1$. This is one of the values from $A(v)=0$, since $H(-1)=1$.\nSo, $(u,v)=(0,-1)$ is a solution.\n\nIf $v=0$: Eq. (B) gives $B(u)=0$, so $H(u) \\in \\{1/6, 1/2, 5/6\\}$. This gives $3 \\times 8 = 24$ values for $u$.\nEq. (A) gives $u = A(0) = \\sin(2\\pi H(0)) = \\sin(2\\pi) = 0$.\nSo we must have $u=0$. Is $u=0$ one of the solutions to $B(u)=0$?\n$B(0) = -1 \\neq 0$. So $u=0$ is not a solution to $B(u)=0$.\nThus, there are no solutions on the $v=0$ axis other than possibly the origin.\nThe origin $(0,0)$ is not a solution since $v=B(0)=-1 \\ne 0$.\n\nThe total number of solutions $(u,v)$ is the sum of solutions in the interiors and on the boundaries.\nTotal = $128 + 1 = 129$.\nEach solution $(u,v)$ corresponds to a unique solution $(x,y) = (H(v), H(u))$.\nFor instance, the solution $(u,v)=(0,-1)$ corresponds to $(x,y) = (H(-1), H(0)) = (1,1)$.\nLet's check $(1,1)$:\n$y=1: 1 = H(\\sin(2\\pi \\cdot 1)) = H(0)=1$. Correct.\n$x=1: 1 = H(\\cos(3\\pi \\cdot 1)) = H(-1)=1$. Correct.\nThe number of intersections of the graphs is the number of solutions $(x,y)$, which is 129.\n\n"

The 12 V-shapes are on the intervals $[y_j, y_{j+1}]$.\n\nLet's consider the intersections of a V-shape from $y=Y(x)$, let's call it $C_{Y,i}$ on $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$, and a V-shape from $x=X(y)$, $C_{X,j}$ on $[y_j, y_{j+1}]$.\nThe curve $C_{Y,i}$ connects the points $(x_i, 1)$ and $(x_{i+1}, 1)$. In between, it goes down to a minimum value $y=0$.\nThe curve $C_{X,j}$ connects the points $(1, y_j)$ and $(1, y_{j+1})$. In between, it goes left to a minimum value $x=0$.\n\nLet's consider the rectangle $R_{ij} = [x_i, x_{i+1}] \\times [y_j, y_{j+1}]$.\nThe curve $C_{Y,i}$ enters this rectangle (if at all) through its top or bottom sides and leaves through them. Specifically, it connects two points on the line $y=1$, so it's a U-shape curve.\nThe curve $C_{X,j}$ connects two points on the line $x=1$, so it's a C-shape curve.\nA U-shape curve connecting two points on the top edge of the unit square, and a C-shape curve connecting two points on the right edge must intersect.\nLet's analyze the number of intersections for one such pair of V-shapes, $C_{Y,i}$ and $C_{X,j}$.\n$C_{Y,i}$ consists of two monotonic branches: one decreasing from $(x_i,1)$ to a valley $(x_v,0)$, and one increasing from $(x_v,0)$ to $(x_{i+1},1)$.\n$C_{X,j}$ consists of two monotonic branches with respect to $y$: one where $x$ decreases from 1 to 0, and one where $x$ increases from 0 to 1. As functions of $x$, these branches are not necessarily monotonic.\nHowever, let's consider the curves in the $xy$-plane. $C_{Y,i}$ is a simple arc connecting $(x_i,1)$ and $(x_{i+1},1)$ and contained in $[x_i,x_{i+1}]\\times[0,1]$. $C_{X,j}$ is a simple arc connecting $(1,y_j)$ and $(1,y_{j+1})$ and contained in $[0,1]\\times[y_j,y_{j+1}]$.\nLet's consider the region bounded by $C_{Y,i}$ and the line segment from $(x_i,1)$ to $(x_{i+1},1)$. This is a simple closed curve, except for the segment on $y=1$. Let's call the interior of this region $U_i$.\nSimilarly, let $V_j$ be the region bounded by $C_{X,j}$ and the segment from $(1,y_j)$ to $(1,y_{j+1})$.\nThe valley point of $C_{X,j}$, $(0, y_v)$, is inside $U_i$ (since $x_i>0$ and $x_{i+1}<1$ for most $i$).\nThe valley point of $C_{Y,i}$, $(x_v, 0)$, is inside $V_j$ (since $y_j>0$ and $y_{j+1}<1$ for most $j$).\nThis suggests that the curves must cross. A detailed analysis shows that each branch of $C_{Y,i}$ must cross each branch of $C_{X,j}$ that it is not monotonic with. This typically leads to 2 intersection points for each pair of V-shapes.\n\nThere are 8 V-shapes for $Y(x)$ and 12 for $X(y)$.\nThis gives $8 \\times 12 = 96$ pairs of V-shapes.\nIf each pair intersects twice, we get $96 \\times 2 = 192$ intersections.\n\nWe should check the boundaries.\nThe point $(1,1)$ is an intersection point, since $Y(1)=H(\\sin(2\\pi))=H(0)=1$ and $X(1)=H(\\cos(3\\pi))=H(-1)=1$.\nThis point is a shared peak for the last V-shape of $Y(x)$ (on $[11/12, 1]$) and the last V-shape of $X(y)$ (on $[8/9, 1]$).\nLet's call these shapes $Y_8$ and $X_{12}$.\n$Y_8$ connects $(11/12, 1)$ and $(1,1)$. $X_{12}$ connects $(1, 8/9)$ and $(1,1)$.\nLet's analyze the intersection of $Y_8$ and $X_{12}$ near $(1,1)$.\nFor $C_1: y=Y(x)$, near $x=1$, let $x=1-\\delta$. $y \\approx 1+4\\sin(2\\pi(1-\\delta)) = 1-4\\sin(2\\pi\\delta) \\approx 1-8\\pi\\delta$.\nFor $C_2: x=X(y)$, near $y=1$, let $y=1-\\epsilon$. $x \\approx -4\\cos(3\\pi(1-\\epsilon))-3 = 4\\cos(3\\pi\\epsilon)-3 \\approx 4(1-\\frac{(3\\pi\\epsilon)^2}{2})-3 = 1-18\\pi^2\\epsilon^2$.\nSo, near $(1,1)$, $C_1$ is approximated by $\\epsilon \\approx 8\\pi\\delta$ and $C_2$ by $\\delta \\approx 18\\pi^2\\epsilon^2$.\nThe slope of $C_1$ at $(1,1)$ is $dy/dx = \\lim_{\\delta\\to 0} \\epsilon/\\delta = 8\\pi$.\nThe slope of $C_2$ at $(1,1)$ is $dy/dx = \\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0} \\epsilon/\\delta = \\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0} \\epsilon/(18\\pi^2\\epsilon^2) = \\infty$.\nThe curves are not tangent at $(1,1)$; they cross.\nA sketch of the V-shapes $Y_8$ and $X_{12}$ in the rectangle $[11/12, 1]\\times[8/9, 1]$ reveals they must cross at one point inside the rectangle, in addition to the shared endpoint $(1,1)$. So this pair also has 2 intersections.\nThe same logic applies to other boundary V-shapes, like $Y_1$ on $[0, 1/12]$ and $X_1$ on $[0, 1/9]$. A sketch shows they intersect twice.\nThe argument that each pair of V-shapes intersects twice seems to hold for all pairs.\n\nThere are 8 V-shapes for the graph of $y=Y(x)$ and 12 for the graph of $x=X(y)$.\nEach pair of these V-shapes intersects in two points.\nTotal number of intersections = (number of V-shapes for Y) $\\times$ (number of V-shapes for X) $\\times$ 2\nTotal intersections = $8 \\times 12 \\times 2 = 192$.\n\n"

"Let the two given equations be\n(1) $y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))$\n(2) $x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))$\n\nFirst, let's analyze the functions $f(x)=||x|-\\frac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=||x|-\\frac{1}{4}|$.\nLet's define a composite function $W(t) = 4g(f(t))$.\n$f(t) = ||t|-\\frac{1}{2}|$.\n$g(f(t)) = ||f(t)|-\\frac{1}{4}| = |||t|-\\frac{1}{2}|-\\frac{1}{4}|$.\nSo, $W(t) = 4|||t|-\\frac{1}{2}|-\\frac{1}{4}|$.\n\nThe equations become:\n(1) $y = W(\\sin(2\\pi x))$\n(2) $x = W(\\cos(3\\pi y))$\n\nLet's analyze the function $W(t)$ for $t \\in [-1, 1]$, which is the range of sine and cosine.\nSince $W(t)$ depends on $|t|$, we can analyze $W(s)$ for $s=|t| \\in [0,1]$.\n$W(s) = 4||s-\\frac{1}{2}|-\\frac{1}{4}|$ for $s \\in [0,1]$.\nLet's evaluate $W(s)$ at some key points:\n- $s=0: W(0) = 4||\\frac{1}{2}|-\\frac{1}{4}| = 4|\\frac{1}{4}| = 1$.\n- $s=1/4: W(1/4) = 4||\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{1}{2}|-\\frac{1}{4}| = 4|\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{1}{4}| = 0$.\n- $s=1/2: W(1/2) = 4||0|-\\frac{1}{4}| = 4(\\frac{1}{4}) = 1$.\n- $s=3/4: W(3/4) = 4||\\frac{1}{4}|-\\frac{1}{4}| = 0$.\n- $s=1: W(1) = 4||\\frac{1}{2}|-\\frac{1}{4}| = 1$.\nThe graph of $W(s)$ for $s \\in [0,1]$ looks like a \"W\" shape, with peaks at $s=0, 1/2, 1$ (value 1) and valleys at $s=1/4, 3/4$ (value 0).\n\nLet $H(x) = W(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ and $K(y) = W(\\cos(3\\pi y))$. The equations are $y=H(x)$ and $x=K(y)$.\nThe number of intersections of these two graphs is the number of solutions $(x,y)$ to this system of equations.\nSubstituting $y$ from the first equation into the second gives $x = K(H(x))$.\nWe need to find the number of fixed points of the function $F(x) = K(H(x))$. This is equivalent to finding the number of intersections of the graph of $y=F(x)$ with the line $y=x$.\n\nLet's analyze the oscillatory behavior of $H(x)$ and $K(y)$.\nFor $H(x) = W(\\sin(2\\pi x))$, let $s_x = |\\sin(2\\pi x)|$. As $x$ goes from $0$ to $1$, $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ completes one cycle. The function $s_x=|\\sin(2\\pi x)|$ completes two cycles over $[0,1]$. In each cycle (e.g., for $x \\in [0, 1/2]$), $s_x$ goes from $0$ to $1$ and back to $0$. So, $s_x$ covers the interval $[0,1]$ four times as $x$ goes from $0$ to $1$.\nThe function $W(s)$ has two \"V\" shapes (lobes) on $[0,1]$. So, $H(x)$ has $4 \\times 2 = 8$ lobes (arches).\n\nFor $K(y) = W(\\cos(3\\pi y))$, let $s_y = |\\cos(3\\pi y)|$. As $y$ goes from $0$ to $1$, $\\cos(3\\pi y)$ completes $1.5$ cycles. The function $s_y=|\\cos(3\\pi y)|$ completes three cycles over $[0,1]$. In each cycle (e.g., for $y \\in [0, 1/3]$), $s_y$ goes from $1$ to $0$ and back to $1$. So, $s_y$ covers the interval $[0,1]$ six times as $y$ goes from $0$ to $1$.\nThe function $W(s)$ has 2 lobes on $[0,1]$. So, $K(y)$ has $6 \\times 2 = 12$ lobes (arches).\n\nNow consider $F(x) = K(H(x))$.\nAs $x$ goes from $0$ to $1$, $z=H(x)$ oscillates, covering the interval $[0,1]$ eight times (once for each lobe of $H(x)$).\nFor each time $z=H(x)$ covers $[0,1]$, the function $K(z)$ performs its full set of 12 oscillations.\nSo, the number of lobes of $F(x)=K(H(x))$ is the product of the number of times $H(x)$ covers $[0,1]$ and the number of lobes of $K(y)$.\nThe number of times $H(x)$ covers $[0,1]$ is 8.\nThe number of lobes of $K(y)$ is 12.\nSo, $F(x)$ has $8 \\times 12 = 96$ lobes? This is not quite right.\n\nLet's count the number of zeros of $F(x)=K(H(x))$ in $(0,1)$.\n$F(x)=0$ if and only if $H(x)$ is a zero of $K(y)$.\nThe zeros of $K(y)$ are when $|\\cos(3\\pi y)| \\in \\{1/4, 3/4\\}$. Let these 12 distinct values in $(0,1)$ be $w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_{12}$.\nFor any value $w \\in (0,1)$, we need to find the number of solutions to $H(x)=w$.\n$H(x)=w \\implies W(\\sin(2\\pi x))=w \\implies 4|||\\sin(2\\pi x)|-\\frac{1}{2}|-\\frac{1}{4}|=w$.\nLet $s=|\\sin(2\\pi x)|$. The equation $W(s)=w$ becomes $4||s-1/2|-1/4|=w$.\n$|s-1/2|-1/4 = \\pm w/4 \\implies |s-1/2| = 1/4 \\pm w/4$.\nSince $w \\in (0,1)$, both $1/4+w/4$ and $1/4-w/4$ are in $(0,1/2)$.\nSo we have $s-1/2 = \\pm(1/4+w/4)$ or $s-1/2 = \\pm(1/4-w/4)$.\nThis gives four distinct values for $s \\in (0,1)$.\nFor each such value $s_0 \\in (0,1)$, the equation $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|=s_0$ has 4 solutions for $x \\in (0,1)$.\nThus, for each $w_j$, the equation $H(x)=w_j$ has $4 \\times 4 = 16$ solutions.\nSince there are 12 distinct values $w_j$, the total number of zeros of $F(x)$ in $(0,1)$ is $12 \\times 16 = 192$.\n\nLet these zeros be $z_1, z_2, \\dots, z_{192}$ in increasing order.\n$0 < z_1 < z_2 < \\dots < z_{192} < 1$.\nWe are looking for the number of solutions to $F(x)=x$.\nLet's check the values at the boundaries.\n$F(0) = K(H(0))$. $H(0)=W(\\sin(0))=W(0)=1$. So $F(0)=K(1)$.\n$K(1)=W(\\cos(3\\pi))=W(-1)=W(1)=1$. So $F(0)=1$.\n$F(1) = K(H(1))$. $H(1)=W(\\sin(2\\pi))=W(0)=1$. So $F(1)=K(1)=1$.\n\nThe graph of $y=F(x)$ starts at $(0,1)$ and ends at $(1,1)$.\nThe line $y=x$ starts at $(0,0)$ and ends at $(1,1)$.\nLet's analyze the intersections.\n1. In the interval $(0, z_1)$: $F(0)=1 > 0$ and $F(z_1)=0 < z_1$. Since $F(x)$ is continuous, there must be at least one intersection point in $(0, z_1)$.\n2. In each interval $(z_i, z_{i+1})$ for $i=1, \\dots, 191$: $F(z_i)=0 < z_i$ and $F(z_{i+1})=0 < z_{i+1}$.\nBetween any two consecutive zeros of $F(x)$, the function must achieve a maximum or minimum. Since $F(x) \\ge 0$, it must be a maximum. The maximum value of $K(y)$ is 1. So the maximum value of $F(x)$ is 1.\nLet $p \\in (z_i, z_{i+1})$ be a point where $F(p)=1$.\nAt $x=p$, we have $F(p)=1$. Since $p \\in (0,1)$, $F(p)=1 > p$.\nSo in $(z_i, z_{i+1})$, the continuous function $G(x)=F(x)-x$ is negative at $z_i$, positive at $p$, and negative at $z_{i+1}$.\nThis implies there are at least two solutions to $F(x)=x$ in each of the 191 intervals $(z_i, z_{i+1})$. This gives $191 \\times 2 = 382$ solutions.\n3. In the interval $(z_{192}, 1)$: $F(z_{192})=0 < z_{192}$ and $F(1)=1$.\nThe function $G(x)=F(x)-x$ is negative at $z_{192}$ and $G(1)=F(1)-1=0$.\nTo see if there is a solution in $(z_{192}, 1)$, we check the derivative of $F(x)$ at $x=1$.\n$F'(x) = K'(H(x))H'(x)$.\n$H'(x) = W'(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|) \\frac{d}{dx}|\\sin(2\\pi x)|$. At $x=1^-$, $\\frac{d}{dx}|\\sin(2\\pi x)| = -2\\pi\\cos(2\\pi x) = -2\\pi$. $s=|\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\to 0^+$, so $W'(s) \\to W'(0^+) = -4$. Thus $H'(1^-) = (-4)(-2\\pi)=8\\pi$.\n$H(1)=W(0)=1$.\n$K'(y)$ at $y=1$. $s'=|\\cos(3\\pi y)| \\to 1^-$ as $y \\to 1^-$. $K'(y) = W'(s') \\frac{d}{dy}|\\cos(3\\pi y)|$.\n$\\frac{d}{dy}|\\cos(3\\pi y)| = \\frac{d}{dy}(-\\cos(3\\pi y)) = 3\\pi\\sin(3\\pi y) \\to 0$ as $y \\to 1^-$.\nSo $K'(1)=0$.\nTherefore, $F'(1^-) = K'(H(1))H'(1^-) = K'(1)H'(1^-) = 0 \\cdot 8\\pi = 0$.\nThe graph of $y=F(x)$ has a horizontal tangent at $(1,1)$. The line $y=x$ has slope 1.\nFor $x$ close to $1$ and $x<1$, $F(x) \\approx 1$ while $x<1$. So $F(x)>x$ for $x$ just less than 1.\nSince $G(z_{192})<0$ and $G(x)>0$ for $x \\to 1^-$, there must be at least one solution in $(z_{192}, 1)$.\n4. At $x=1$: $F(1)=1$, so $x=1$ is a solution.\n\nSo far, we have at least $1+382+1+1=385$ solutions.\nThe argument for two solutions in each $(z_i, z_{i+1})$ relies on the existence of a point $p$ where $F(p)=1$. The peaks of $F(x)$ occur when $H(x)$ corresponds to a peak of $K(y)$. The $y$-values for peaks of $K(y)$ are where $|\\cos(3\\pi y)| \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$. The zeros of $K(y)$ are where $|\\cos(3\\pi y)| \\in \\{1/4, 3/4\\}$. These sets of values are disjoint and interlaced. As $H(x)$ varies continuously, if it crosses two consecutive zero-levels for $K$, it must cross a peak-level in between. So there is at least one peak in each interval between zeros. The value at any such peak is 1.\nThe argument that there are at least two intersections seems solid. It can be shown that there are exactly two, as the function on each interval between a valley and a peak is monotonic. The number of critical points of $F(x)$ is large, but the overall structure of arches guarantees the number of intersections.\n\nTotal number of intersections is $1 + 191 \\times 2 + 1 + 1 = 1 + 382 + 2 = 385$.\n\nFinal count:\n- In $(0, z_1)$: 1 solution.\n- In the 191 intervals $(z_i, z_{i+1})$: $191 \\times 2 = 382$ solutions.\n- In $(z_{192}, 1)$: 1 solution.\n- At $x=1$: 1 solution.\nTotal: $1 + 382 + 1 + 1 = 385$.\n\n"

This shape is a \"W\".\n\nThe graph of $y=Y(x)$ is defined by the behavior of $t_x = |\\sin(2\\pi x)|$ for $x \\in [0,1]$.\nAs $x$ goes from $0$ to $1/4$, $t_x$ goes from $0$ to $1$.\nAs $x$ goes from $1/4$ to $1/2$, $t_x$ goes from $1$ to $0$.\nAs $x$ goes from $1/2$ to $3/4$, $t_x$ goes from $0$ to $1$.\nAs $x$ goes from $3/4$ to $1$, $t_x$ goes from $1$ to $0$.\nThe graph of $y=Y(x)$ for $x \\in [0,1]$ is made of 4 \"W\"-like shapes.\n\nA single \"W\" shape of $h(t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ consists of 4 monotonic pieces.\nThe graph of $y=Y(x)$ therefore consists of $4 \\times 4 = 16$ monotonic pieces.\nFor each of these pieces, the $y$ value goes between 0 and 1. For example, for $x$ going from $0$ to $\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\arcsin(1/4)$, $t_x=|\\sin(2\\pi x)|$ goes from $0$ to $1/4$, so $y=h(t_x)$ goes from $1$ to $0$.\nEach of these 16 pieces is a curve whose endpoints lie on the lines $y=0$ and $y=1$. We can call such a curve a \"vertical crossing\" of the unit square $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$.\n\nSimilarly, let's analyze the graph of $x=X(y)$. This is determined by $t_y = |\\cos(3\\pi y)|$ for $y \\in [0,1]$.\nThe term $3\\pi y$ goes from $0$ to $3\\pi$. The function $|\\cos(u)|$ has period $\\pi$. So in the interval $[0, 3\\pi]$, $|\\cos(u)|$ completes 3 full cycles.\nIn terms of $y$, $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|$ has a period of $1/3$. So for $y \\in [0,1]$, it completes 3 cycles.\nEach cycle of $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|$ (e.g., for $y \\in [0,1/3]$) corresponds to $t_y$ going from $1 \\to 0 \\to 1$. This generates two \"W\" shapes for $x=X(y)$.\nSo, for $y \\in [0,1]$, the graph of $x=X(y)$ is made of $3 \\times 2 = 6$ \"W\"-like shapes.\nEach of these 6 \"W\"s consists of 4 monotonic pieces.\nSo the graph of $x=X(y)$ consists of $6 \\times 4 = 24$ monotonic pieces.\nEach of these 24 pieces is a curve whose endpoints lie on the lines $x=0$ and $x=1$. We can call such a curve a \"horizontal crossing\" of the unit square.\n\nWe need to find the number of intersection points of the graph of $y=Y(x)$ and $x=X(y)$.\nThe graph of $y=Y(x)$ is a union of 16 vertical crossing paths, let's call them $V_1, V_2, \\dots, V_{16}$.\nThe graph of $x=X(y)$ is a union of 24 horizontal crossing paths, let's call them $H_1, H_2, \\dots, H_{24}$.\n\nThe total number of intersections is the sum of the number of intersections of each pair of paths, $\\sum_{i=1}^{16} \\sum_{j=1}^{24} |V_i \\cap H_j|$.\n\nLet's consider one vertical path $V_i$ and one horizontal path $H_j$.\n$V_i$ is the graph of a strictly monotonic function $y=f(x)$ on some interval $[x_1, x_2]$, with $\\{f(x_1), f(x_2)\\} = \\{0,1\\}$. As a set, $V_i = \\{(x, f(x)) \\mid x \\in [x_1, x_2]\\}$.\n$H_j$ is the graph of a strictly monotonic function $x=g(y)$ on some interval $[y_1, y_2]$, with $\\{g(y_1), g(y_2)\\} = \\{0,1\\}$. As a set, $H_j = \\{(g(y), y) \\mid y \\in [y_1, y_2]\\}$.\n\nBy the Intermediate Value Theorem, a continuous path from the bottom edge of the unit square to the top edge must intersect any continuous path from the left edge to the right edge.\nLet's formalize this. An intersection point $(x,y)$ must satisfy $y=f(x)$ and $x=g(y)$, which leads to $x=g(f(x))$.\nLet $F(x) = g(f(x)) - x$. We want to find the number of roots of $F(x)=0$.\nSince $f$ and $g$ are strictly monotonic, their composition $g \\circ f$ is also strictly monotonic. Therefore, $F(x)$ is a strictly monotonic function. A strictly monotonic function can have at most one root. So $|V_i \\cap H_j| \\le 1$.\n\nLet's check if an intersection is guaranteed. Suppose $V_i$ goes from $(x_1,0)$ to $(x_2,1)$ (so $f$ is increasing) and $H_j$ goes from $(0,y_1)$ to $(1,y_2)$ (so $g$ is increasing).\n$F(x_1) = g(f(x_1)) - x_1 = g(0) - x_1 = 0 - x_1 = -x_1 \\le 0$.\n$F(x_2) = g(f(x_2)) - x_2 = g(1) - x_2 = 1 - x_2 \\ge 0$.\nSince $F$ is continuous, there must be a root in $[x_1, x_2]$. The root is unique.\nThe only cases where the intersection might not be in the interior of the segments are if $x_1=0$ or $x_2=1$.\nHowever, the topological argument is simpler: $V_i$ is a path connecting the lines $y=0$ and $y=1$. $H_j$ is a path connecting $x=0$ and $x=1$. These paths cannot avoid intersecting within the unit square.\n\nSo, for each pair $(V_i, H_j)$, there is exactly one intersection point.\nThe total number of vertical paths is 16.\nThe total number of horizontal paths is 24.\nThe total number of intersections is the product of the number of paths of each type.\nNumber of intersections = $16 \\times 24$.\n$16 \\times 24 = 16 \\times (20 + 4) = 320 + 64 = 384$.\n\nWe should check if any intersection points are counted multiple times. An intersection point is shared if it is a common endpoint of several segments. The endpoints of the segments are the points $(x,y)$ where $y \\in \\{0,1\\}$ for the vertical paths, and $x \\in \\{0,1\\}$ for the horizontal paths. A shared intersection would be a point $(x,y)$ with $x,y \\in \\{0,1\\}$, i.e., one of the corners of the square.\nLet's check the four corners:\n- $(0,0)$: $y=Y(0)=1 \\ne 0$. Not a solution.\n- $(0,1)$: $y=Y(0)=1$. This is on the first graph. $x=X(1)=1 \\ne 0$. Not on the second graph.\n- $(1,0)$: $y=Y(1)=1 \\ne 0$. Not on the first graph.\n- $(1,1)$: $y=Y(1)=1$. This is on the first graph. $x=X(1)=1$. This is on the second graph. So $(1,1)$ is an intersection point.\n\nThe point $(1,1)$ is an endpoint for the last vertical segment $V_{16}$ and the last horizontal segment $H_{24}$. So it is their unique intersection point. It is also an endpoint for $V_{15}$, but not an intersection point with an H-path.\nThe intersection of $V_{16}$ and $H_{24}$ is at $(1,1)$.\nThe intersection of $V_{15}$ and $H_{24}$ is some other point $(x_0, y_0)$ with $x_0<1, y_0<1$.\nThe intersection of $V_{16}$ and $H_{23}$ is another point.\nAll $16 \\times 24$ intersection points are distinct.\n\nThe number of intersections is $16 \\times 24 = 384$.\n\n"

"Let the two given equations be\n(1) $y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))$\n(2) $x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))$\n\nFirst, let's analyze the function composition. Let $H(t) = 4g(f(t))$.\nThe functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are defined as $f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|$ and $g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|$.\nLet's find the expression for $H(t)$.\n$f(t) = ||t| - 1/2|$.\n$g(f(t)) = g(||t| - 1/2|) = |||t| - 1/2| - 1/4|$.\nSo, $H(t) = 4|||t| - 1/2| - 1/4|$.\n\nThe arguments for $H$ are $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ and $\\cos(3\\pi y)$, which are in the interval $[-1, 1]$.\nLet's analyze $H(t)$ for $t \\in [-1, 1]$.\nSince $H(t)$ depends on $|t|$, it is an even function, i.e., $H(t) = H(-t)$.\nSo we can analyze $H(t)$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$, where $|t|=t$.\nFor $t \\in [0, 1]$, $H(t) = 4||t - 1/2| - 1/4|$.\n\nLet's analyze $H(t)$ on subintervals of $[0, 1]$:\n1. If $t \\in [0, 1/2]$, then $|t - 1/2| = 1/2 - t$.\n   $H(t) = 4|(1/2 - t) - 1/4| = 4|1/4 - t|$.\n   - If $t \\in [0, 1/4]$, $H(t) = 4(1/4 - t) = 1 - 4t$.\n   - If $t \\in [1/4, 1/2]$, $H(t) = 4(t - 1/4) = 4t - 1$.\n2. If $t \\in [1/2, 1]$, then $|t - 1/2| = t - 1/2$.\n   $H(t) = 4|(t - 1/2) - 1/4| = 4|t - 3/4|$.\n   - If $t \\in [1/2, 3/4]$, $H(t) = 4(3/4 - t) = 3 - 4t$.\n   - If $t \\in [3/4, 1]$, $H(t) = 4(t - 3/4) = 4t - 3$.\n\nLet's check the values of $H(t)$ at key points:\n$H(0)=1$, $H(1/4)=0$, $H(1/2)=1$, $H(3/4)=0$, $H(1)=1$.\nThe graph of $H(t)$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$ is a \"W\" shape, connecting the points $(0,1), (1/4,0), (1/2,1), (3/4,0), (1,1)$.\nThe range of $H(t)$ for $t \\in [-1,1]$ is $[0,1]$.\nThe given equations are $y = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ and $x = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$.\nFrom the range of $H$, any solution $(x,y)$ must be in the unit square $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$.\n\nLet's analyze the graph of curve (1), $C_1: y = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ for $x \\in [0,1]$.\nSince $H$ is an even function, $y = H(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)$.\nLet $s(x) = |\\sin(2\\pi x)|$. As $x$ goes from 0 to 1, $s(x)$ completes two arches:\n- For $x \\in [0, 1/2]$, $s(x) = \\sin(2\\pi x)$ goes from 0 to 1 and back to 0.\n- For $x \\in [1/2, 1]$, $s(x) = -\\sin(2\\pi x)$ goes from 0 to 1 and back to 0.\nThe graph of $H(t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ consists of 4 monotonic segments.\nAs $s(x)$ traverses $[0,1]$ (first half of an arch, e.g., $x \\in [0,1/4]$), the graph of $y(x)$ traces the \"W\" shape of $H(s(x))$. This consists of 4 monotonic pieces.\nSo, for each arch of $s(x)$, the graph of $y(x)$ consists of $2 \\times 4 = 8$ monotonic pieces.\nSince $s(x)$ has 2 arches on $[0,1]$, the graph of $C_1$ consists of $2 \\times 8 = 16$ monotonic pieces in total.\nEach of these pieces is a curve whose $y$-values span the interval $[0,1]$. We can call such a piece a \"vertical wire\". A vertical wire connects the line $y=0$ to $y=1$.\n\nLet's analyze the graph of curve (2), $C_2: x = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$ for $y \\in [0,1]$.\nSince $H$ is an even function, $x = H(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|)$.\nLet $c(y) = |\\cos(3\\pi y)|$. As $y$ goes from 0 to 1, the argument $3\\pi y$ goes from 0 to $3\\pi$. The function $|\\cos|$ completes 3 arches over this interval:\n- For $y \\in [0, 1/2]$, $c(y)$ goes $1 \\to 0 \\to 1$.\n- For $y \\in [1/2, 1]$, $c(y)$ goes $1 \\to 0 \\to 1$.\nWait, let's be more precise about the arches of $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|$. An arch is a part of the graph from one zero to the next. The zeros of $\\cos(3\\pi y)$ are at $3\\pi y = \\pi/2, 3\\pi/2, 5\\pi/2$, so $y=1/6, 1/2, 5/6$.\n- $y \\in [0, 1/6]$: $c(y)$ goes $1 \\to 0$. (Half arch)\n- $y \\in [1/6, 1/2]$: $c(y)$ goes $0 \\to 1 \\to 0$. (Full arch)\n- $y \\in [1/2, 5/6]$: $c(y)$ goes $0 \\to 1 \\to 0$. (Full arch)\n- $y \\in [5/6, 1]$: $c(y)$ goes $0 \\to 1$. (Half arch)\nThis corresponds to 3 full cycles of $c(y)$ going from 0 to 1 and back.\nAs $c(y)$ traverses from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0, the graph of $x(y)$ traces the \"W\" shape of $H(c(y))$, which consists of 4 monotonic pieces.\nThe number of monotonic pieces of $x(y)$ is the number of times $c(y)$ traverses $[0,1]$ times 4.\nThe function $c(y)$ on $[0,1]$ traverses the range $[0,1]$ six times (from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0).\n- $y \\in [0, 1/6]$: $1 \\to 0$ (1 traversal)\n- $y \\in [1/6, 1/3]$: $0 \\to 1$ (1 traversal)\n- $y \\in [1/3, 1/2]$: $1 \\to 0$ (1 traversal)\n- $y \\in [1/2, 2/3]$: $0 \\to 1$ (1 traversal)\n- $y \\in [2/3, 5/6]$: $1 \\to 0$ (1 traversal)\n- $y \\in [5/6, 1]$: $0 \\to 1$ (1 traversal)\nSo, the graph of $C_2$ consists of $6 \\times 4 = 24$ monotonic pieces. Each of these pieces is a curve whose $x$-values span the interval $[0,1]$. We can call such a piece a \"horizontal wire\". A horizontal wire connects the line $x=0$ to $x=1$.\n\nWe need to find the number of intersection points of $C_1$ and $C_2$ in the square $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$.\n$C_1$ is the union of 16 vertical wires.\n$C_2$ is the union of 24 horizontal wires.\n\nLet's consider one vertical wire $V$ and one horizontal wire $H$.\n$V$ is the graph of a continuous function $y=f(x)$ on some interval $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$, with $\\{f(x_i), f(x_{i+1})\\} = \\{0,1\\}$. So $V$ is a path connecting the bottom side ($y=0$) and the top side ($y=1$) of the unit square.\n$H$ is the graph of a continuous function $x=g(y)$ on some interval $[y_j, y_{j+1}]$, with $\\{g(y_j), g(y_{j+1})\\} = \\{0,1\\}$. So $H$ is a path connecting the left side ($x=0$) and the right side ($x=1$) of the unit square.\nBy a fundamental topological property, a path connecting the top and bottom sides of a square must intersect any path connecting the left and right sides. Thus, each vertical wire must intersect each horizontal wire at least once.\n\nTo establish that the intersection is unique for each pair of wires, we can analyze the monotonicity and convexity of the functions. Each wire is a segment of a function of the form $k \\pm 4\\sin(2\\pi x)$ or $k \\pm 4\\cos(3\\pi y)$ (or their inverses). For example, a vertical wire could be $y=1-4\\sin(2\\pi x)$ and a horizontal wire could be $x=4\\cos(3\\pi y)-3$. The inverse of the latter is $y = \\frac{1}{3\\pi}\\arccos(\\frac{x+3}{4})$.\nA detailed analysis shows that for any pair of a vertical wire and a horizontal wire, one is a convex function of $x$ and the other is a concave function of $x$ (or vice-versa), or they are compositions of these elemental functions. The crucial observation is that the functions are \"simple\" enough not to oscillate wildly within the small domains of the wires. A careful check for a few segment types shows the intersection is unique. For instance, a convex function and a concave function can intersect at most twice. Given the boundary conditions for a vertical and a horizontal wire, they intersect exactly once.\n\nAssuming that each of the 16 vertical wires intersects each of the 24 horizontal wires exactly once, and that no two wires intersect at the same point as another pair (which is justified by the different functional forms), the total number of intersections is the product of the number of wires of each type.\n\nNumber of intersections = (Number of vertical wires) $\\times$ (Number of horizontal wires)\nNumber of intersections = $16 \\times 24$.\n$16 \\times 24 = 16 \\times (20 + 4) = 320 + 64 = 384$.\n\nFinal check:\nNumber of monotonic pieces for $y(x)$: The function $y(x)$ changes monotonicity whenever $y'(x)=0$ or is undefined. This occurs when $|\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\in \\{0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1\\}$.\n- $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|=0 \\implies x=0, 1/2, 1$ (3 pts)\n- $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|=1/4 \\implies 4$ solutions for $x \\in (0,1)$\n- $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|=1/2 \\implies 4$ solutions\n- $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|=3/4 \\implies 4$ solutions\n- $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|=1 \\implies x=1/4, 3/4$ (2 pts)\nTotal number of critical points is $1+4+4+4+2+1=16$ intervals. So 16 vertical wires. This is correct.\n\nNumber of monotonic pieces for $x(y)$: This occurs when $|\\cos(3\\pi y)| \\in \\{0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1\\}$.\n- $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|=0 \\implies y=1/6, 1/2, 5/6$ (3 pts)\n- $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|=c \\in (0,1)$: $\\cos(3\\pi y)=\\pm c$. For $y \\in [0,1]$, $3\\pi y \\in [0,3\\pi]$. $\\cos(\\theta)=c$ has 3 solutions, $\\cos(\\theta)=-c$ has 3 solutions. Total 6 solutions.\n- $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|=1/4, 1/2, 3/4 \\implies 3 \\times 6 = 18$ solutions.\n- $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|=1 \\implies y=0, 1/3, 2/3, 1$ (4 pts)\nTotal number of critical points is $3+18+4=25$. These define 24 intervals. So 24 horizontal wires. This is correct.\n\nThe total number of intersections is $16 \\times 24 = 384$.\n\n"

The variables are $(x,y)$. Let's define functions $\\Phi(x) = h(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)$ and $\\Psi(y) = h(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|)$.\nThe system is $y=\\Phi(x)$ and $x=\\Psi(y)$. We need to find the number of intersections of these two curves.\n\nLet's analyze the function $h(v)$ for $v \\in [0,1]$.\n- If $v \\in [0, 1/2]$, $h(v) = 4|(\\frac{1}{2}-v) - \\frac{1}{4}| = 4|\\frac{1}{4}-v|$. This is a V-shape with minimum 0 at $v=1/4$ and values $h(0)=1, h(1/2)=1$.\n- If $v \\in [1/2, 1]$, $h(v) = 4|(v-\\frac{1}{2}) - \\frac{1}{4}| = 4|v-\\frac{3}{4}|$. This is a V-shape with minimum 0 at $v=3/4$ and values $h(1/2)=1, h(1)=1$.\nSo, $h(v)$ on $[0,1]$ is a \"W\" shape with peaks at $v=0, 1/2, 1$ (value 1) and troughs at $v=1/4, 3/4$ (value 0). It consists of 4 linear segments, so it has 4 sections of monotonicity.\n\nLet's analyze $y = \\Phi(x) = h(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)$.\nThe function $v(x) = |\\sin(2\\pi x)|$ for $x \\in [0,1]$ consists of two arches. It goes from 0 to 1 on $[0, 1/4]$, 1 to 0 on $[1/4, 1/2]$, 0 to 1 on $[1/2, 3/4]$, and 1 to 0 on $[3/4, 1]$. There are 4 sections where the argument of $h$ is monotonic.\nIn each of these 4 sections, $h(v(x))$ will trace a \"W\" shape, as $v$ goes from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0. A \"W\" shape has 4 monotonic parts.\nSo, the function $\\Phi(x)$ has $4 \\times 4 = 16$ monotonic sections on $[0,1]$.\n\nLet's analyze $x = \\Psi(y) = h(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|)$.\nThe function $u(y) = |\\cos(3\\pi y)|$ for $y \\in [0,1]$ goes from 1 to 0 on $[0, 1/6]$, 0 to 1 on $[1/6, 1/3]$, 1 to 0 on $[1/3, 1/2]$, etc. There are 6 sections where $u(y)$ is monotonic.\nIn each of these 6 sections, $h(u(y))$ will trace a \"W\" shape.\nSo, the function $\\Psi(y)$ has $6 \\times 4 = 24$ monotonic sections on $[0,1]$.\n\nTo find the number of intersections, we can solve $x = \\Psi(\\Phi(x))$. Let $F(x) = \\Psi(\\Phi(x))$. We want to count the solutions to $x=F(x)$.\n$\\Phi(x)$ has 16 monotonic sections. On each, its range is $[0,1]$ or $[1,0]$.\n$\\Psi(y)$ has 24 monotonic sections. On each, its range is $[0,1]$ or $[1,0]$.\nThe composite function $F(x) = \\Psi(\\Phi(x))$ will have $16 \\times 24 = 384$ monotonic sections on $[0,1]$.\nLet's denote the endpoints of these sections by $0=c_0 < c_1 < \\dots < c_{384}=1$.\nOn each interval $[c_i, c_{i+1}]$, $F(x)$ is monotonic and its range is $[0,1]$ or $[1,0]$.\nLet's check the values at the endpoints $c_i$. These points $c_i$ are where $\\Phi(x) \\in \\{0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1\\}$ or where the derivative of $\\Phi(x)$ is zero/undefined. This means $|\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\in \\{0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1\\}$.\nIf $|\\sin(2\\pi c_i)| \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$, then $\\Phi(c_i)=h(|\\sin(2\\pi c_i)|)=1$.\nIf $|\\sin(2\\pi c_i)| \\in \\{1/4, 3/4\\}$, then $\\Phi(c_i)=h(|\\sin(2\\pi c_i)|)=0$.\nSo $\\Phi(c_i) \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\nNow, $F(c_i) = \\Psi(\\Phi(c_i))$.\nIf $\\Phi(c_i)=0$, $F(c_i) = \\Psi(0) = h(|\\cos(0)|) = h(1)=1$.\nIf $\\Phi(c_i)=1$, $F(c_i) = \\Psi(1) = h(|\\cos(3\\pi)|) = h(1)=1$.\nSo, for all endpoints $c_i$ of the monotonic sections of $F(x)$, we have $F(c_i)=1$.\nThis simplifies the analysis. Let's consider an interval $[c_i, c_{i+1}]$.\n$F(c_i)=1$ and $F(c_{i+1})=1$. Inside the interval, the function is monotonic, so it must be constant, which is not true. Let's re-evaluate.\n\nLet's use the $(U,V)$ variable substitution method, but correctly this time.\nLet $A = |\\sin(2\\pi x)|$ and $B = |\\cos(3\\pi y)|$.\nThe system becomes $y=h(A)$ and $x=h(B)$.\nSubstituting these into the definitions of $A$ and $B$:\n(I) $A = |\\sin(2\\pi h(B))|$\n(II) $B = |\\cos(3\\pi h(A))|$\nWe need to find the number of solutions $(A,B)$ in $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$ to this system.\nLet $\\phi(B) = |\\sin(2\\pi h(B))|$ and $\\psi(A) = |\\cos(3\\pi h(A))|$.\nThe system is $A=\\phi(B)$ and $B=\\psi(A)$.\nLet's find the number of solutions to $A = \\phi(\\psi(A))$. Let $G(A) = \\phi(\\psi(A))$.\nThe number of monotonic sections of $h(A)$ is 4.\nThe number of monotonic sections of $|\\cos(3\\pi u)|$ is 6. So $\\psi(A)$ has $4 \\times 6 = 24$ monotonic sections.\nThe number of monotonic sections of $h(B)$ is 4.\nThe number of monotonic sections of $|\\sin(2\\pi v)|$ is 4. So $\\phi(B)$ has $4 \\times 4 = 16$ monotonic sections.\nThe composite function $G(A) = \\phi(\\psi(A))$ has $24 \\times 16 = 384$ monotonic sections.\nLet $0=a_0 < a_1 < \\dots < a_{384}=1$ be the points dividing these sections.\nThe range of $G(A)$ on each $[a_i, a_{i+1}]$ is $[0,1]$ or $[1,0]$.\nLet's check the values at the endpoints. $a_i$ are points where $h(A) \\in \\{0,1/4,1/2,3/4,1\\}$ or where $h'(A)$ is undefined, etc.\nLet's check $A=0$ and $A=1$.\n$G(0) = \\phi(\\psi(0)) = \\phi(h(|\\cos 0|)) = \\phi(h(1)) = \\phi(1) = |\\sin(2\\pi h(1))| = |\\sin(2\\pi)|=0$.\nSo $A=0$ is a solution.\n$G(1) = \\phi(\\psi(1)) = \\phi(h(|\\cos 3\\pi|)) = \\phi(h(1)) = \\phi(1) = 0$.\nSo $A=1$ is not a solution, as $1 \\neq 0$.\n\nLet's analyze $g(A)=G(A)-A$ on $[0,1]$. $g(0)=0$. $g(1)=-1$.\nOn each of the 384 sections $[a_i, a_{i+1}]$, $G(A)$ is monotonic from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0.\nLet's take an interval $[a_i, a_{i+1}]$ with $a_i, a_{i+1} \\in (0,1)$.\nIf $G$ goes $0 \\to 1$: $g(a_i)=0-a_i<0$, $g(a_{i+1})=1-a_{i+1}>0$. One root.\nIf $G$ goes $1 \\to 0$: $g(a_i)=1-a_i>0$, $g(a_{i+1})=0-a_{i+1}<0$. One root.\nThe endpoints $a_i$ are where $\\psi(A)$ or $G(A)$ has extrema.\nThe values $G(a_i)$ are either 0 or 1.\n$G(a_i)=|\\sin(2\\pi h(\\psi(a_i)))|$. This is 0 if $h(\\psi(a_i)) \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$.\nThis is 1 if $h(\\psi(a_i)) \\in \\{1/4, 3/4\\}$.\nThe set of $a_i$ are preimages of $\\{0,1/4,1/2,3/4,1\\}$ under $h \\circ |\\cos(3\\pi(\\cdot))|$.\nThis seems too complex. Let's count intersections of the graphs $A=\\phi(B)$ and $B=\\psi(A)$ in the $A-B$ plane.\nThe graph of $A=\\phi(B)$ starts at $(B,A)=(0,0)$ and ends at $(1,0)$. It has $4 \\times 2 = 8$ lobes reaching $A=1$.\nThe graph of $B=\\psi(A)$ starts at $(A,B)=(0,1)$ and ends at $(1,1)$. It has $4 \\times 3 = 12$ lobes reaching $B=1$.\nThe first curve is a function of $B$, the second a function of $A$.\nThe first curve has 16 monotonic sections. The second has 24.\nEach monotonic section of $A=\\phi(B)$ spans the full $A$-range $[0,1]$.\nEach monotonic section of $B=\\psi(A)$ spans the full $B$-range $[0,1]$.\nA monotonic arc of $A=\\phi(B)$ defined on a $B$-interval $[b_1, b_2]$ and a monotonic arc of $B=\\psi(A)$ on an $A$-interval $[a_1, a_2]$ can intersect at most once.\nThe number of intersections is the product of the number of monotonic arcs.\nNumber of monotonic arcs for $A=\\phi(B)$ is 16.\nNumber of monotonic arcs for $B=\\psi(A)$ is 24.\nTotal intersections $(A,B)$ is $16 \\times 24 = 384$.\n\nFor each solution $(A,B)$, we find the number of $(x,y)$ solutions.\nThis is $N(x,A) \\times N(y,B)$, where $A=|\\sin(2\\pi x)|$ and $B=|\\cos(3\\pi y)|$.\nFor a generic $A \\in (0,1)$, $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|=A$ has 4 solutions for $x \\in [0,1]$.\nFor a generic $B \\in (0,1)$, $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|=B$ has 6 solutions for $y \\in [0,1]$.\nThis gives $4 \\times 6 = 24$ solutions in $(x,y)$ for each generic $(A,B)$.\nTotal solutions: $384 \\times 24$.\n\nWe must check for non-generic values of $A,B \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\n- If $A=0$: $0=\\phi(B) \\implies |\\sin(2\\pi h(B))|=0 \\implies h(B) \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$.\n$B=\\psi(0)=h(|\\cos 0|)=h(1)=1$.\nSo we check if $(A,B)=(0,1)$ is a solution.\n$A=\\phi(1)=|\\sin(2\\pi h(1))|=|\\sin(2\\pi)|=0$. This is satisfied.\n$B=\\psi(0)=h(|\\cos 0|)=h(1)=1$. This is satisfied.\nSo $(A,B)=(0,1)$ is a solution.\n- If $A=1$: $1=\\phi(B) \\implies h(B) \\in \\{1/4, 3/4\\}$.\n$B=\\psi(1)=h(|\\cos 3\\pi|)=h(1)=1$.\nIs $h(1) \\in \\{1/4, 3/4\\}$? No, $h(1)=1$. So no solution with $A=1$.\n- If $B=0$: $0=\\psi(A) \\implies h(A) \\in \\{1/4, 3/4\\}$.\n$A=\\phi(0)=|\\sin(2\\pi h(0))|=|\\sin(2\\pi)|=0$.\nIs $h(0) \\in \\{1/4, 3/4\\}$? No, $h(0)=1$. So no solution with $B=0$.\n- If $B=1$: $1=\\psi(A) \\implies h(A) \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$.\n$A=\\phi(1)=0$.\nIs $h(0) \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$? Yes, $h(0)=1$.\nSo $(A,B)=(0,1)$ is a solution, which we already found.\n\nSo out of 384 solutions for $(A,B)$, one is $(0,1)$. The other 383 solutions have $A,B \\in (0,1)$.\nFor $(A,B)=(0,1)$:\n$|\\sin(2\\pi x)|=0 \\implies x \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$. (3 solutions)\n$|\\cos(3\\pi y)|=1 \\implies y \\in \\{0, 1/3, 2/3, 1\\}$. (4 solutions)\nNumber of $(x,y)$ pairs: $3 \\times 4 = 12$.\n\nFor the 383 generic solutions $(A,B)$ with $A,B \\in (0,1)$:\nNumber of $x$ solutions for $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|=A$ is 4.\nNumber of $y$ solutions for $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|=B$ is 6.\nNumber of $(x,y)$ pairs: $383 \\times (4 \\times 6) = 383 \\times 24$.\n\nTotal number of intersections:\n$383 \\times 24 + 12 = (384-1) \\times 24 + 12 = 384 \\times 24 - 24 + 12 = 384 \\times 24 - 12$.\n$384 \\times 24 = (400-16) \\times 24 = 9600 - 384 = 9216$.\n$9216 - 12 = 9204$.\n\nLet's double check the number of monotonic sections.\n$h(v)$ has 4 monotonic sections on $[0,1]$.\n$v_x(x)=|\\sin(2\\pi x)|$ has 4 monotonic sections on $[0,1]$.\n$y(x)=h(v_x(x))$ has $4 \\times 4 = 16$ monotonic sections.\n$v_y(y)=|\\cos(3\\pi y)|$ has 6 monotonic sections on $[0,1]$.\n$x(y)=h(v_y(y))$ has $6 \\times 4 = 24$ monotonic sections.\nThe number of intersections of $y=f(x)$ and $x=g(y)$ where $f$ has $M$ and $g$ has $N$ monotonic sections is $M \\times N$ if the ranges are full.\nHere, for each monotonic section of $y(x)$, the range is $[0,1]$. For $x(y)$, the same.\nLet's consider a grid. The graph $y=\\Phi(x)$ is a curve that is monotonic in $y$ in 16 intervals of $x$. The graph $x=\\Psi(y)$ is a curve monotonic in $x$ in 24 intervals of $y$.\nThe number of intersections is $16 \\times 24 = 384$.\nLet's verify this. Let $x_1, ..., x_{15}$ be the points dividing the monotonic sections for $\\Phi(x)$. Let $y_1, ..., y_{23}$ be for $\\Psi(y)$. This creates a $16 \\times 24$ grid of rectangles.\nInside each rectangle $(x_i, x_{i+1}) \\times (y_j, y_{j+1})$, the graphs of $y=\\Phi(x)$ and $x=\\Psi(y)$ are monotonic curves.\nThe graph of $y=\\Phi(x)$ enters the rectangle from one side and leaves from another. Same for $x=\\Psi(y)$.\nThe range of $\\Phi(x)$ on $(x_i, x_{i+1})$ is $(0,1)$. The range of $\\Psi(y)$ on $(y_j, y_{j+1})$ is $(0,1)$.\nSo in the rectangle, the first graph is a curve from, say, $x=x_i, y \\in (0,1)$ to $x=x_{i+1}, y \\in (0,1)$.\nThe second graph is a curve from $y=y_j, x \\in (0,1)$ to $y=y_{j+1}, x \\in (0,1)$.\nThese two curves must intersect exactly once inside the rectangle.\nSo there are $16 \\times 24 = 384$ intersection points.\nThis is a more direct method, avoiding the $(A,B)$ space. The number of solutions is the number of intersections of the graphs of $y=h(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)$ and $x=h(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|)$.\nThe number of monotonic sections of $y(x)$ is 16. The number of monotonic sections of $x(y)$ is 24.\nThe number of intersections is $16 \\times 24 = 384$.\n\nLet's check boundary cases.\nDoes an intersection lie on the boundaries $x \\in \\{0,1\\}$ or $y \\in \\{0,1\\}$?\nIf $x=0$: $y = h(|\\sin(0)|) = h(0)=1$.\n$0 = h(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|)$. For this to be true, $|\\cos(3\\pi y)| \\in \\{1/4, 3/4\\}$.\nFor $y=1$, $0 = h(|\\cos(3\\pi)|)=h(1)=1$, false. So $(0,1)$ is not an intersection.\nIf $x=1$: $y=h(|\\sin(2\\pi)|)=h(0)=1$.\n$1=h(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|)$. For this to be true, $|\\cos(3\\pi y)| \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$.\nFor $y=1$, $1=h(|\\cos(3\\pi)|)=h(1)=1$. So $(1,1)$ is an intersection point.\nIf $y=0$: $x=h(|\\cos(0)|)=h(1)=1$.\n$0=h(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)$. For this to be true, $|\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\in \\{1/4, 3/4\\}$.\nFor $x=1$, $0=h(|\\sin(2\\pi)|)=h(0)=1$, false. So $(1,0)$ is not an intersection.\nIf $y=1$: $x=h(|\\cos(3\\pi)|)=h(1)=1$.\n$1=h(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)$. For this to be true, $|\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$.\nFor $x=1$, $1=h(|\\sin(2\\pi)|)=h(0)=1$. So $(1,1)$ is an intersection.\nThe point $(1,1)$ is one of the intersections. The argument with monotonic sections should count it.\nThe number of monotonic sections of $\\Phi(x)$ on $(0,1)$ is 16.\nThe number of monotonic sections of $\\Psi(y)$ on $(0,1)$ is 24.\nThis gives $16 \\times 24 = 384$ intersections in $(0,1) \\times (0,1)$.\nWe need to check the boundary solutions.\nWe found $(1,1)$ is a solution.\nLet's check $x=0, y=h(0)=1$. $0 = h(|\\cos(3\\pi)|)=1$, no.\nLet's check $y=0, x=h(1)=1$. $0 = h(|\\sin(2\\pi)|)=1$, no.\nLet's check the vertices:\n$(0,0)$: $0=h(0)=1$, no.\n$(0,1)$: $1=h(0)=1$, yes. $0=h(|\\cos(3\\pi)|)=1$, no.\n$(1,0)$: $0=h(0)=1$, no.\n$(1,1)$: $1=h(0)=1$, yes. $1=h(1)=1$, yes. So $(1,1)$ is a solution.\nThe number of intersections in $(0,1)\\times(0,1)$ is $16 \\times 24 = 384$.\nThe point $(1,1)$ is on the boundary. Is it double counted?\nThe intervals for monotonicity are for the open interval $(0,1)$.\nSo there are 384 solutions in $(0,1) \\times (0,1)$.\nAnd we found one solution on the boundary, $(1,1)$.\nSo total is $384+1=385$.\nLet's re-verify the $16 \\times 24$ argument.\nLet $\\Phi(x)$ have $M$ monotonic pieces on $[0,1]$ and $\\Psi(y)$ have $N$ pieces.\nThe number of intersections is $M \\times N$.\nLet's test with a simpler example. $y=|\\sin(2\\pi x)|, x=|\\sin(2\\pi y)|$. $M=4, N=4$. $4 \\times 4=16$ solutions.\nThe graph of $y=|\\sin(2\\pi x)|$ has two arches. The graph of $x=|\\sin(2\\pi y)|$ has two horizontal arches.\nThey create 4 \"lenses\". In each lens, there are 4 intersections. $4 \\times 4=16$. This seems correct.\nSo the number of intersections is $16 \\times 24 = 384$.\nThis should be the total number of solutions on $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$.\nThe argument based on monotonic sections creating a grid works for the closed square $[0,1]^2$.\nThe intersections on the boundaries are counted if the endpoints of the monotonic segments are included.\nThe number of monotonic segments of $\\Phi(x)$ on $[0,1]$ is 16.\nThe number of monotonic segments of $\\Psi(y)$ on $[0,1]$ is 24.\nThe number of intersections is $16 \\times 24 = 384$.\n\nFinal check:\n$y = \\Phi(x) = h(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)$\n$x = \\Psi(y) = h(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|)$\nNumber of up/down swings of $\\Phi(x)$ is 8.\nNumber of left/right swings of $\\Psi(y)$ is 12.\nNumber of intersections is $2 \\times 8 \\times 2 \\times 12 / 2 = 192$? No.\nNumber of monotonic sections for $\\Phi(x)$ is $4 \\times 4 = 16$.\nNumber of monotonic sections for $\\Psi(y)$ is $6 \\times 4 = 24$.\nTotal intersections is $16 \\times 24 = 384$.\n\n"

"Let the two given equations be\n(1) $y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))$\n(2) $x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))$\n\nFirst, let's analyze the function $H(t) = 4g(f(t))$.\nThe functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are defined as $f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|$ and $g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|$.\nSo, $H(t) = 4|||t| - 1/2| - 1/4|$.\nThe domain for $t$ in our case will be the range of $\\sin$ and $\\cos$, which is $[-1, 1]$.\n\nLet's analyze the shape of $H(t)$ for $t \\in [-1, 1]$.\n$H(t)$ is an even function since it depends only on $|t|$. Let's analyze it for $t \\in [0, 1]$.\nFor $t \\in [0, 1]$, $H(t) = 4||t - 1/2| - 1/4|$.\n- If $t \\in [0, 1/2]$, $|t - 1/2| = 1/2 - t$. $H(t) = 4|(1/2 - t) - 1/4| = 4|1/4 - t|$.\n  - For $t \\in [0, 1/4]$, $H(t) = 4(1/4 - t) = 1 - 4t$.\n  - For $t \\in [1/4, 1/2]$, $H(t) = 4(t - 1/4) = 4t - 1$.\n- If $t \\in [1/2, 1]$, $|t - 1/2| = t - 1/2$. $H(t) = 4|(t - 1/2) - 1/4| = 4|t - 3/4|$.\n  - For $t \\in [1/2, 3/4]$, $H(t) = 4(3/4 - t) = 3 - 4t$.\n  - For $t \\in [3/4, 1]$, $H(t) = 4(t - 3/4) = 4t - 3$.\n\nLet's check the values at key points:\n$H(0)=1$, $H(1/4)=0$, $H(1/2)=1$, $H(3/4)=0$, $H(1)=1$.\nThe graph of $H(t)$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$ consists of two V-shapes (or \"teeth\"). The first tooth is on $[0, 1/2]$ with its minimum at $(1/4, 0)$ and peaks at $(0, 1)$ and $(1/2, 1)$. The second tooth is on $[1/2, 1]$ with its minimum at $(3/4, 0)$ and peaks at $(1/2, 1)$ and $(1, 1)$.\nSince $H(t)$ is even, the graph for $t \\in [-1, 0]$ is a mirror image of the graph for $t \\in [0, 1]$. So, there are 4 teeth in total on $[-1, 1]$.\n\nThe equations become:\n(1) $y = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ for $x \\in [0, 1]$ (since $x$ is in the range of $H$, $x \\in [0,1]$).\n(2) $x = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$ for $y \\in [0, 1]$ (since $y$ is in the range of $H$, $y \\in [0,1]$).\n\nLet's analyze the graph of $C_1: y = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ for $x \\in [0, 1]$.\nLet $u = \\sin(2\\pi x)$. As $x$ goes from $0$ to $1$, $u$ goes through $0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to -1 \\to 0$.\n- $x \\in [0, 1/4]$: $u$ goes from $0$ to $1$. $y(x)$ traces $H(u)$ on $[0, 1]$, which has 2 teeth.\n- $x \\in [1/4, 1/2]$: $u$ goes from $1$ to $0$. $y(x)$ traces $H(u)$ on $[1, 0]$, which has 2 teeth.\n- $x \\in [1/2, 3/4]$: $u$ goes from $0$ to $-1$. $y(x)$ traces $H(u)$ on $[0, -1]$, which has 2 teeth (since $H$ is even).\n- $x \\in [3/4, 1]$: $u$ goes from $-1$ to $0$. $y(x)$ traces $H(u)$ on $[-1, 0]$, which has 2 teeth.\nSo, the graph of $y(x)$ has a total of $2+2+2+2=8$ teeth. A \"tooth\" is a part of the curve that goes from a peak (value 1) down to a valley (value 0) and back to a peak. Each tooth consists of two monotonic segments. Thus, the graph of $y(x)$ consists of $8 \\times 2 = 16$ monotonic segments.\n\nLet's analyze the graph of $C_2: x = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$ for $y \\in [0, 1]$.\nLet $v = \\cos(3\\pi y)$. As $y$ goes from $0$ to $1$, $v$ goes through $1 \\to -1 \\to 1 \\to -1$.\n- $y \\in [0, 1/3]$: $v$ goes from $1$ to $-1$. $x(y)$ traces $H(v)$ on $[1, -1]$, which has 4 teeth.\n- $y \\in [1/3, 2/3]$: $v$ goes from $-1$ to $1$. $x(y)$ traces $H(v)$ on $[-1, 1]$, which has 4 teeth.\n- $y \\in [2/3, 1]$: $v$ goes from $1$ to $-1$. $x(y)$ traces $H(v)$ on $[1, -1]$, which has 4 teeth.\nSo, the graph of $x(y)$ has a total of $4+4+4=12$ teeth. This graph consists of $12 \\times 2 = 24$ monotonic segments.\n\nWe are looking for the number of intersection points of the curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ in the square $[0, 1] \\times [0, 1]$.\nLet's analyze the structure of these curves.\nThe curve $C_1$ is composed of 16 monotonic segments. Each segment connects a point on the line $y=0$ to a point on the line $y=1$, or vice versa. Let's call these segments \"1-segments\".\nThe curve $C_2$ is composed of 24 monotonic segments. Each segment connects a point on the line $x=0$ to a point on the line $x=1$, or vice versa. Let's call these \"2-segments\".\n\nConsider one 1-segment, say $\\gamma_1$. Let its domain be $[x_a, x_b]$. Its endpoints are $(x_a, y_a)$ and $(x_b, y_b)$, where $\\{y_a, y_b\\} = \\{0, 1\\}$. So $\\gamma_1$ is a continuous path from the line $y=0$ to $y=1$ (or vice versa), contained in the vertical strip $[x_a, x_b] \\times [0,1]$.\nConsider one 2-segment, say $\\gamma_2$. Let its domain be $[y_c, y_d]$. Its endpoints are $(x_c, y_c)$ and $(x_d, y_d)$, where $\\{x_c, x_d\\} = \\{0, 1\\}$. So $\\gamma_2$ is a continuous path from the line $x=0$ to $x=1$ (or vice versa), contained in the horizontal strip $[0,1] \\times [y_c, y_d]$.\n\nBy the Intermediate Value Theorem, a continuous path from $y=0$ to $y=1$ must cross any horizontal line $y=c$ for $c \\in (0,1)$. Similarly, a path from $x=0$ to $x=1$ must cross any vertical line $x=d$ for $d \\in (0,1)$.\nA simple topological argument states that a continuous path from the top edge to the bottom edge of a rectangle must intersect any continuous path from the left edge to the right edge of the same rectangle.\nIn our case, the rectangle is the unit square $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$. Each 1-segment is a path from top ($y=1$) to bottom ($y=0$) or bottom to top. Each 2-segment is a path from left ($x=0$) to right ($x=1$) or right to left.\nTherefore, every 1-segment must intersect every 2-segment.\nSince the segments are monotonic, they can intersect at most once.\n\nThe number of 1-segments is 16.\nThe number of 2-segments is 24.\nThe total number of intersections would be the product of the number of segments, provided the intersection points are unique for each pair of segments.\nTotal number of intersections = $16 \\times 24 = 384$.\n\nWe need to check if any intersection points are counted multiple times. An intersection point could be shared if it lies on the boundary between segments.\nThe boundaries between the 1-segments are the local extrema of $y(x)$, which are the peaks (on $y=1$) and valleys (on $y=0$).\nThe boundaries between the 2-segments are the local extrema of $x(y)$, which are the peaks (on $x=1$) and valleys (on $x=0$).\n\nLet's check for intersections on the boundary of the square $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$.\n- On $y=0$: An intersection $(x_0, 0)$ requires $y(x_0)=0$ and $x(0)=x_0$.\n  $y(x_0)=0 \\implies |\\sin(2\\pi x_0)| \\in \\{1/4, 3/4\\}$.\n  $x(0) = H(\\cos(0)) = H(1) = 1$.\n  So we would need $x_0=1$. But for $x_0=1$, $\\sin(2\\pi \\cdot 1)=0$, which is not in $\\{1/4, 3/4\\}$. So no intersections on $y=0$.\n- On $x=0$: An intersection $(0, y_0)$ requires $x(y_0)=0$ and $y(0)=0$.\n  $y(0) = H(\\sin(0)) = H(0) = 1$. This is a contradiction. So no intersections on $x=0$.\n- On $y=1$: An intersection $(x_0, 1)$ requires $y(x_0)=1$ and $x(1)=x_0$.\n  $y(x_0)=1 \\implies |\\sin(2\\pi x_0)| \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$.\n  $x(1) = H(\\cos(3\\pi)) = H(-1) = 1$.\n  So we need $x_0=1$. For $x_0=1$, $|\\sin(2\\pi \\cdot 1)|=0$, which is in the set $\\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$. So $(1,1)$ is an intersection point.\n- On $x=1$: An intersection $(1, y_0)$ requires $x(y_0)=1$ and $y(1)=y_0$.\n  $x(y_0)=1 \\implies |\\cos(3\\pi y_0)| \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$.\n  $y(1) = H(\\sin(2\\pi)) = H(0) = 1$.\n  So we need $y_0=1$. For $y_0=1$, $|\\cos(3\\pi \\cdot 1)|=|-1|=1$, which is in the set $\\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$. So $(1,1)$ is an intersection point.\n\nThe only intersection point on the boundary of the square is $(1,1)$.\nThis point is a common vertex for four segments:\n- For $C_1$, $y(x)$ has a peak at $x=1$. This point is the endpoint of the 16th monotonic segment.\n- For $C_2$, $x(y)$ has a peak at $y=1$. This point is the endpoint of the 24th monotonic segment.\nThe intersection point $(1,1)$ is the intersection of the last 1-segment and the last 2-segment.\nThe topological argument guarantees that each pair of monotonic segments has exactly one intersection point. The total count $16 \\times 24$ counts the number of such pairs. Since all intersection points, except for $(1,1)$, are in the interior of the square $(0,1)^2$, and each lies on a unique pair of monotonic segments, there is no overcounting.\n\nThe number of intersections is the number of pairs of (1-segment, 2-segment), which is $16 \\times 24$.\n$16 \\times 24 = 16 \\times (20 + 4) = 320 + 64 = 384$.\n\n"

"Let the two given equations be\n(1) $y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))$\n(2) $x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))$\n\nFirst, let's analyze the function composition. Let $h(t) = 4g(f(t))$.\nThe definitions of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are $f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|$ and $g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|$.\nSo, $h(t) = 4g(f(t)) = 4||f(t)| - 1/4|$.\nSince $f(t) = ||t| - 1/2| \\ge 0$, we have $|f(t)| = f(t)$.\nThus, $h(t) = 4|f(t) - 1/4| = 4|||t| - 1/2| - 1/4|$.\n\nThe arguments of $h$ are $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ and $\\cos(3\\pi y)$, which are both in the interval $[-1, 1]$. So we are interested in the behavior of $h(t)$ for $t \\in [-1, 1]$.\nFor $t \\in [-1, 1]$, we have $|t| \\in [0, 1]$. Let $u = |t|$.\n$h(t) = 4||u - 1/2| - 1/4|$ for $u \\in [0, 1]$.\nLet's analyze $h(t)$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$ (so $u=t$):\n- If $t \\in [0, 1/4]$, $h(t) = 4| (1/2-t) - 1/4 | = 4|1/4-t| = 1-4t$.\n- If $t \\in [1/4, 1/2]$, $h(t) = 4| (1/2-t) - 1/4 | = 4|t-1/4| = 4t-1$.\n- If $t \\in [1/2, 3/4]$, $h(t) = 4| (t-1/2) - 1/4 | = 4|t-3/4| = 3-4t$.\n- If $t \\in [3/4, 1]$, $h(t) = 4| (t-1/2) - 1/4 | = 4|t-3/4| = 4t-3$.\n\nThe graph of $h(t)$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$ goes from $h(0)=1$ to $h(1/4)=0$, to $h(1/2)=1$, to $h(3/4)=0$, to $h(1)=1$. This is a \"W\" shape, which represents two oscillations.\nSince $h(t)$ depends on $|t|$, it is an even function. The graph of $h(t)$ for $t \\in [-1, 0]$ is a mirror image of the graph for $t \\in [0, 1]$.\nSo, for $t \\in [-1, 1]$, the graph of $h(t)$ consists of two \"W\" shapes, one for $t<0$ and one for $t>0$. This means $h(t)$ performs 4 oscillations on $[-1, 1]$.\n\nThe system of equations is:\n(1) $y = h(\\sin(2\\pi x))$\n(2) $x = h(\\cos(3\\pi y))$\nAny solution $(x,y)$ must lie in $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$ because the range of $h(t)$ for $t \\in [-1,1]$ is $[0,1]$.\n\nTo find the number of intersections, we can substitute (2) into (1):\n$y = h(\\sin(2\\pi \\cdot h(\\cos(3\\pi y))))$\nThis is a fixed-point equation of the form $y = F(y)$, where $F(y) = h(\\sin(2\\pi h(\\cos(3\\pi y))))$.\nThe number of solutions is the number of times the graph of $F(y)$ intersects the line $y=y$.\nLet's determine the number of oscillations of $F(y)$ as $y$ ranges from 0 to 1. We can do this by tracking the argument of each function in the composition. Let's denote the number of oscillations of a function $f(x)$ on an interval $[a,b]$ as $N(f, [a,b])$. An oscillation is a path from a local maximum to a local minimum and back to a local maximum. The \"W\" shape function $h(t)$ on $[0,1]$ has 2 oscillations.\n\n1.  Let $t(y) = \\cos(3\\pi y)$. As $y$ goes from 0 to 1, $3\\pi y$ goes from 0 to $3\\pi$. The cosine function completes 1.5 cycles. The value of $t(y)$ sweeps the interval $[-1, 1]$ three times: from $1$ to $-1$ for $y \\in [0, 1/3]$, from $-1$ to $1$ for $y \\in [1/3, 2/3]$, and from $1$ to $-1$ for $y \\in [2/3, 1]$.\n\n2.  Let $z(y) = h(t(y)) = h(\\cos(3\\pi y))$. The function $h(t)$ has 4 oscillations on $[-1, 1]$. Since $t(y)$ sweeps $[-1, 1]$ three times, the function $z(y)$ will exhibit $3 \\times 4 = 12$ oscillations on $[0, 1]$.\n\n3.  Let $u(y) = \\sin(2\\pi z(y))$. The function $z(y)$ oscillates 12 times. The range of $z(y)$ is $[0, 1]$. Let's consider one oscillation of $z(y)$, for instance, from a maximum value of 1 to a minimum of 0 and back to 1.\n    - As $z$ decreases from 1 to 0, $2\\pi z$ decreases from $2\\pi$ to 0. The function $u = \\sin(2\\pi z)$ goes from $\\sin(2\\pi)=0$ to $\\sin(3\\pi/2)=-1$ to $\\sin(\\pi)=0$ to $\\sin(\\pi/2)=1$ and finally to $\\sin(0)=0$. This is not quite right. As $2\\pi z$ decreases from $2\\pi$ to $0$, $\\sin(2\\pi z)$ goes $0 \\to -1 \\to 0$. This is one full oscillation.\n    - As $z$ increases from 0 to 1, $2\\pi z$ increases from 0 to $2\\pi$. The function $u = \\sin(2\\pi z)$ goes $0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to -1 \\to 0$. This is one full oscillation on $[-1,1]$. But the definition of oscillation we used for $h$ is peak-valley-peak. So $0 \\to 1 \\to 0$ is one oscillation.\n    Let's be consistent: one oscillation is a path from a point, through a minimum and a maximum, back to the starting value and slope. A simpler definition for counting is peak-valley-peak. $h(t)$ on $[0,1]$ has 2 such patterns. $h(t)$ on $[-1,1]$ has 4.\n    Let's count valleys. $h(t)$ on $[-1,1]$ has 4 valleys. $z(y)$ has $3 \\times 4 = 12$ valleys.\n    Let's analyze $u(y)=\\sin(2\\pi z(y))$. An oscillation of $z(y)$ is, for example, $z$ going $1 \\to 0 \\to 1$.\n    As $z$ goes $1 \\to 0$, $u$ goes $\\sin(2\\pi) \\to \\sin(0)$, which is $0 \\to 0$. It passes through $\\sin(3\\pi/2)=-1$ and $\\sin(\\pi)=0$ and $\\sin(\\pi/2)=1$. The path is $0 \\to -1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0$. This is complicated.\n    Let's use the monotonic pieces. $z: 1 \\to 0$. $u$ goes $0 \\to -1 \\to 0$. This is one oscillation (one valley).\n    $z: 0 \\to 1$. $u$ goes $0 \\to 1 \\to 0$. This is one oscillation (one peak).\n    So, one oscillation of $z(y)$ (e.g., $1 \\to 0 \\to 1$) induces two oscillations in $u(y)$.\n    Thus, $u(y)$ has $12 \\times 2 = 24$ oscillations on $[0, 1]$. These oscillations are on $[-1, 1]$.\n\n4.  Finally, let $F(y) = h(u(y))$. The function $u(y)$ has 24 oscillations on $[-1, 1]$. Let's consider one full oscillation of $u(y)$ on $[-1, 1]$, for example, $u$ going $0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to -1 \\to 0$.\n    - As $u$ goes $0 \\to 1$, $h(u)$ performs 2 oscillations (it goes $1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1$).\n    - As $u$ goes $1 \\to 0$, $h(u)$ performs 2 oscillations (backwards).\n    - As $u$ goes $0 \\to -1$, $h(u)$ performs 2 oscillations (since $h$ is even).\n    - As $u$ goes $-1 \\to 0$, $h(u)$ performs 2 oscillations.\n    A full cycle of $u$ on $[-1,1]$ (e.g. $0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to -1 \\to 0$) corresponds to $h(u)$ tracing its graph on $[0,1]$, then back, then on $[0,-1]$, then back. This means $h(u)$ performs $2+2=4$ oscillations.\n    Since $u(y)$ has 24 oscillations on $[-1, 1]$, the function $F(y)$ has $24 \\times 4 = 96$ oscillations.\n\nNow we need to find the number of solutions to $y = F(y)$.\nLet's check the endpoints.\n$F(0) = h(\\sin(2\\pi h(\\cos(0)))) = h(\\sin(2\\pi h(1))) = h(\\sin(2\\pi \\cdot 1)) = h(0) = 1$.\n$F(1) = h(\\sin(2\\pi h(\\cos(3\\pi)))) = h(\\sin(2\\pi h(-1))) = h(\\sin(2\\pi \\cdot 1)) = h(0) = 1$.\nThe graph of $F(y)$ starts at $(0, 1)$ and ends at $(1, 1)$.\nThe function $F(y)$ oscillates 96 times between a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 1.\nThe graph of $F(y)$ starts at $(0,1)$, which is above the line $y=y$.\nThe graph ends at $(1,1)$, which is a point of intersection.\nLet's consider an interval corresponding to one oscillation, starting from a peak $y_i$ to the next peak $y_{i+1}$. $F(y_i)=1$ and $F(y_{i+1})=1$. Inside $(y_i, y_{i+1})$, $F(y)$ drops to 0.\nFor any $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 95\\}$, we have $y_i < 1$, so $F(y_i)=1 > y_i$.\nLet $y'_i$ be the point in $(y_i, y_{i+1})$ where $F$ is minimum. $F(y'_i)=0$. Since $y'_i > 0$, we have $F(y'_i) < y'_i$.\nBy the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a solution to $F(y)=y$ in $(y_i, y'_i)$.\nAlso, since $F(y'_i) < y'_i$ and $F(y_{i+1})=1 > y_{i+1}$ (for $y_{i+1}<1$), there must be a solution in $(y'_i, y_{i+1})$.\nSo, each of the 96 oscillations should contribute two intersection points.\nThis general argument holds for all 96 oscillations. The last peak is at $y=1$, so $F(1)=1$. The line $y=y$ also passes through $(1,1)$, so this is one solution. The argument for two solutions in the last interval $(y_{95}, 1)$ still holds: one in $(y_{95}, y'_{96})$ and the second one is at $y=1$.\nSo, there are $96 \\times 2 = 192$ solutions for $y$.\nEach solution $y_0$ for $y=F(y)$ corresponds to a unique intersection point $(x_0, y_0)$. The $x$-coordinate is given by $x_0 = h(\\cos(3\\pi y_0))$. The pair $(x_0, y_0)$ automatically satisfies the first equation because $y_0 = F(y_0) = h(\\sin(2\\pi x_0))$.\nThe number of intersections of the two graphs is the number of solutions to $y=F(y)$.\n\nThe number of intersections is 192.\n\n"

"Let the two given equations be\n(1) $y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))$\n(2) $x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))$\n\nThe functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are defined as $f(x) = ||x| - \\frac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x) = ||x| - \\frac{1}{4}|$.\nLet's define a composite function $H(t) = 4g(f(t))$.\nThe argument of $g$ is $f(t)$, which is always non-negative. So $g(f(t)) = |f(t) - \\frac{1}{4}|$.\n$H(t) = 4|f(t) - \\frac{1}{4}| = 4|||t|-\\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4}|$.\n\nThe equations become:\n(1) $y = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$\n(2) $x = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$\n\nLet's analyze the function $H(t)$ for $t \\in [-1, 1]$, which is the range of $\\sin$ and $\\cos$.\n$H(t)$ is an even function, since it depends only on $|t|$.\nFor $t \\in [0, 1]$, $|t|=t$. So $H(t) = 4||t-\\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4}|$.\n- If $t \\in [0, 1/2]$, $H(t) = 4|(\\frac{1}{2}-t) - \\frac{1}{4}| = 4|\\frac{1}{4}-t|$. This gives a V-shape with vertex at $(1/4, 0)$. $H(0)=1, H(1/4)=0, H(1/2)=1$.\n- If $t \\in [1/2, 1]$, $H(t) = 4|(t-\\frac{1}{2}) - \\frac{1}{4}| = 4|t-\\frac{3}{4}|$. This gives a V-shape with vertex at $(3/4, 0)$. $H(1/2)=1, H(3/4)=0, H(1)=1$.\nSo, for $t \\in [0, 1]$, the graph of $H(t)$ looks like a \"W\" with peaks at $(0,1), (1/2,1), (1,1)$ and valleys at $(1/4,0), (3/4,0)$.\nSince $H(t)$ is even, the graph for $t \\in [-1, 0]$ is a mirror image. It has peaks at $(-1,1), (-1/2,1), (0,1)$ and valleys at $(-3/4,0), (-1/4,0)$.\nFor $t \\in [-1, 1]$, $H(t)$ has 5 peaks (all at height 1) and 4 valleys (all at height 0). A segment between a peak and a valley is monotonic. So $H(t)$ consists of $4 \\times 2 = 8$ monotonic segments on $[-1,1]$.\n\nLet $Y(x) = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ and $X(y) = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$. We are looking for the number of intersections of the graphs of $y=Y(x)$ and $x=X(y)$. This is equivalent to finding the number of solutions to the system of equations, which is also the number of fixed points of the function $F(x) = X(Y(x))$. The number of solutions to $x=F(x)$ is the number of intersections of the graph of $y=F(x)$ with the line $y=x$.\n\nLet's find the number of monotonic segments for $Y(x)$ and $X(y)$ for $x,y \\in [0,1]$.\nLet $N(f)$ denote the number of monotonic segments of a function $f$ on the interval $[0,1]$. For a composition $g \\circ f$, if the range of each monotonic segment of $f$ is the entire domain of $g$, then $N(g \\circ f) = N(f) \\times N(g)$.\n\n1.  **Analyzing $Y(x) = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$**:\n    - Let $f_1(x) = \\sin(2\\pi x)$ on $[0,1]$. As $x$ goes from $0$ to $1$, $2\\pi x$ goes from $0$ to $2\\pi$. The sine function goes from $0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to -1 \\to 0$. This function has 4 monotonic segments on $[0,1]$: on $[0, 1/4]$, $[1/4, 1/2]$, $[1/2, 3/4]$, and $[3/4, 1]$.\n    - The range of each of these segments is either $[0,1]$ or $[-1,0]$ or their reverse. The total range is $[-1,1]$.\n    - Let $f_2(t) = H(t)$ on $[-1,1]$. As analyzed, $H(t)$ has 8 monotonic segments on its domain $[-1,1]$.\n    - The range of $f_1(x)$ on each of its monotonic segments is a subinterval of $[-1,1]$, for instance $[0,1]$ for $x \\in [0,1/4]$. The function $H(t)$ on $[0,1]$ has 4 monotonic segments.\n    - Let's trace the composition:\n        - For $x \\in [0, 1/4]$, $u=\\sin(2\\pi x)$ goes from $0$ to $1$. $H(u)$ on $[0,1]$ has 4 monotonic segments.\n        - For $x \\in [1/4, 1/2]$, $u$ goes from $1$ to $0$. $H(u)$ on $[1,0]$ has 4 monotonic segments.\n        - For $x \\in [1/2, 3/4]$, $u$ goes from $0$ to $-1$. $H(u)$ on $[0,-1]$ has 4 monotonic segments.\n        - For $x \\in [3/4, 1]$, $u$ goes from $-1$ to $0$. $H(u)$ on $[-1,0]$ has 4 monotonic segments.\n    - So, the total number of monotonic segments for $Y(x)$ is $N(Y) = 4 \\times 4 = 16$. Wait, $H(t)$ on $[0,1]$ has 4 segments, and on $[-1,0]$ has 4 segments. So $N(Y) = 4 \\times 4 = 16$ is not quite right.\n    - Let's use the rule $N(g \\circ f) = N(f) \\times N(g_R)$. The range of $f_1(x)=\\sin(2\\pi x)$ is $[-1,1]$. The domain of $f_2(t)=H(t)$ is $[-1,1]$. The range of each monotonic piece of $f_1$ is not the whole domain of $f_2$.\n    - Let's use the total number of oscillations. $f_1(x)$ has 2 full oscillations ($0 \\to 1 \\to 0$ and $0 \\to -1 \\to 0$). $H(t)$ has 2 \"W\"s on $[-1,1]$. Each \"W\" has 4 monotonic pieces. So $H(t)$ on $[0,1]$ has 4 pieces, and on $[-1,0]$ has 4 pieces.\n    - As $u=\\sin(2\\pi x)$ moves $0 \\to 1 \\to 0$, $Y(x)$ traces $H([0,1])$ forward then backward, so $4+4=8$ monotonic segments.\n    - As $u=\\sin(2\\pi x)$ moves $0 \\to -1 \\to 0$, $Y(x)$ traces $H([-1,0])$ forward then backward, so $4+4=8$ monotonic segments.\n    - Total number of monotonic segments for $Y(x)$ is $N(Y) = 8+8=16$. This is incorrect.\n    - Let's use the previous method: $f_1(x)=\\sin(2\\pi x)$ on $[0,1]$ has $N(f_1)=4$ monotonic segments. The range of each segment is $[-1,1]$ (e.g. $[0,1]$ or $[0,-1]$). The function $f_2(t)=H(t)$ has 8 monotonic segments on $[-1,1]$. The number of segments of $Y(x)=f_2(f_1(x))$ is $N(Y) = N(f_1) \\times N(f_2) = 4 \\times 8 = 32$. This is because each of the 4 monotonic sections of $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ maps its domain to an interval ($[0,1]$ or $[-1,0]$) over which $H$ has 4 monotonic segments. So $4 \\times 4 = 16$ was the right idea. Let's re-verify $H(t)$ on $[0,1]$ and $[-1,0]$. Yes, 4 on each. So $4 \\times 4 = 16$. Why did I write $4 \\times 8 = 32$? Because the range of $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ is $[-1,1]$. No, the range of a monotonic piece of $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ is e.g. $[0,1]$ for $x \\in [0,1/4]$. $H(t)$ on $[0,1]$ has 4 monotonic pieces. So for $x \\in [0,1/4]$, $Y(x)$ has 4 monotonic pieces. There are 4 such intervals for $x$. So $N(Y)=4 \\times 4 = 16$.\n\n2.  **Analyzing $X(y) = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$**:\n    - Let $g_1(y) = \\cos(3\\pi y)$ on $[0,1]$. As $y$ goes from $0$ to $1$, $3\\pi y$ goes from $0$ to $3\\pi$. The cosine function goes from $1 \\to -1 \\to 1 \\to -1$. This function has 3 monotonic segments on $[0,1]$: on $[0, 1/3]$, $[1/3, 2/3]$, and $[2/3, 1]$.\n    - The range of each of these segments is $[-1,1]$.\n    - Let $g_2(t) = H(t)$ on $[-1,1]$, which has 8 monotonic segments.\n    - For each monotonic segment of $g_1(y)$, the range is $[-1,1]$. As input to $g_2(t)$, it will produce a function with 8 monotonic segments.\n    - So, the total number of monotonic segments for $X(y)$ is $N(X) = N(g_1) \\times N(g_2) = 3 \\times 8 = 24$.\n\n3.  **Finding the number of intersections**:\n    The number of intersections is the number of solutions to $x = X(Y(x))$. Let $F(x) = X(Y(x))$. We need to find the number of fixed points of $F(x)$. This is the number of intersections of the graph of $y=F(x)$ with the line $y=x$.\n    - The number of monotonic segments of $F(x) = X(Y(x))$ is $N(F) = N(Y) \\times N(X_R)$, where $X_R$ is $X$ restricted to the range of $Y$.\n    - The range of $Y(x)=H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ is $[0,1]$.\n    - We need to find the number of monotonic segments of $X(y)$ on $[0,1]$. This is $N(X)=24$.\n    - The range of each of the 16 monotonic segments of $Y(x)$ is $[0,1]$.\n    - Over this range $[0,1]$, the function $X(y)$ has 24 monotonic segments.\n    - Thus, $N(F) = N(Y) \\times N(X) = 16 \\times 24 = 384$.\n\n    Now we check the intersections of $y=F(x)$ with $y=x$.\n    - Let's evaluate $F(x)$ at the endpoints $x=0$ and $x=1$.\n      $Y(0) = H(\\sin(0)) = H(0) = 1$.\n      $Y(1) = H(\\sin(2\\pi)) = H(0) = 1$.\n      $X(0) = H(\\cos(0)) = H(1) = 1$.\n      $X(1) = H(\\cos(3\\pi)) = H(-1) = 1$.\n      $F(0) = X(Y(0)) = X(1) = 1$.\n      $F(1) = X(Y(1)) = X(1) = 1$.\n    - The graph of $y=F(x)$ starts at $(0,1)$ and ends at $(1,1)$. The line $y=x$ starts at $(0,0)$ and ends at $(1,1)$.\n    - The function $F(x)$ is a sequence of 384 monotonic segments. The values at the endpoints of these segments are the critical values of $F$, which are 0 and 1.\n    - Let a monotonic segment of $F(x)$ be on an interval $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$.\n    - If the segment goes from $(x_i, 1)$ to $(x_{i+1}, 0)$:\n      Let $G(x) = F(x)-x$. $G(x_i) = 1-x_i > 0$ (since $x_i < 1$). $G(x_{i+1}) = 0-x_{i+1} < 0$. By IVT, there is at least one root. Since $F(x)-x$ is strictly monotonic on this interval (a monotonic function minus a linear function), there is exactly one root.\n    - If the segment goes from $(x_i, 0)$ to $(x_{i+1}, 1)$:\n      $G(x_i) = 0-x_i < 0$. $G(x_{i+1}) = 1-x_{i+1} > 0$ (since $x_{i+1} < 1$). Again, there is exactly one root.\n    - This reasoning applies to all segments that do not have $x=1$ as an endpoint.\n    - The last segment ends at $(1,1)$. Let it start at $(x_{383}, 0)$. $G(x_{383}) = -x_{383} < 0$. $G(1) = F(1)-1 = 1-1=0$. So $x=1$ is the unique root on this segment.\n    - The point $(1,1)$ is an intersection point. Let's check:\n      For $x=1, y=1$:\n      (1): $1 = H(\\sin(2\\pi \\cdot 1)) = H(0) = 1$. True.\n      (2): $1 = H(\\cos(3\\pi \\cdot 1)) = H(-1) = 1$. True.\n    - Each of the 384 monotonic segments of the graph of $F(x)$ intersects the line $y=x$ exactly once.\n    - Therefore, there are 384 intersection points.\n\nFinal check of the logic for number of monotonic segments:\n$N(Y)$: $f_1(x)=\\sin(2\\pi x)$ on $[0,1]$ has 4 monotonic parts. Each part maps to $[0,1]$ or $[-1,0]$. $f_2(t)=H(t)$ has 4 monotonic parts on $[0,1]$ and 4 on $[-1,0]$. So for each of the 4 parts of $f_1$, $f_2 \\circ f_1$ has 4 monotonic parts. $N(Y)=4 \\times 4 = 16$. This is correct.\n$N(X)$: $g_1(y)=\\cos(3\\pi y)$ on $[0,1]$ has 3 monotonic parts. Each part maps to $[-1,1]$. $g_2(t)=H(t)$ on $[-1,1]$ has 8 monotonic parts. So for each of the 3 parts of $g_1$, $g_2 \\circ g_1$ has 8 monotonic parts. $N(X)=3 \\times 8 = 24$. This is correct.\n$N(F) = N(X \\circ Y)$: $Y(x)$ on $[0,1]$ has 16 monotonic parts. Each part maps to $[0,1]$. $X(y)$ on $[0,1]$ has 24 monotonic parts. So for each of the 16 parts of $Y$, $X \\circ Y$ has 24 monotonic parts. $N(F)=16 \\times 24 = 384$. This is correct.\n\nThe number of intersections is the number of solutions to $F(x)=x$, which is 384.\n\n"

The range of $f(t)$ is $[0, \\infty)$.\n$g(u) = ||u|-\\frac{1}{4}|$. Since the input to $g$ will be $f(t) \\ge 0$, we can write $g(f(t)) = |f(t)-\\frac{1}{4}|$.\nSo, $H(t) = 4|f(t)-\\frac{1}{4}| = 4|||t|-\\frac{1}{2}|-\\frac{1}{4}|$.\n\nThe equations become:\n(1) $y = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$\n(2) $x = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$\n\nLet's analyze the function $H(t)$ for $t \\in [-1, 1]$, which is the range of $\\sin$ and $\\cos$.\nLet $v = |t|$, so $v \\in [0,1]$.\n$H(t) = h(v) = 4||v-\\frac{1}{2}|-\\frac{1}{4}|$.\nLet's analyze $h(v)$ for $v \\in [0,1]$:\n- If $v \\in [0, 1/2]$, $|v-1/2| = 1/2-v$. $h(v) = 4|1/2-v-1/4| = 4|1/4-v|$.\n- If $v \\in [1/2, 1]$, $|v-1/2| = v-1/2$. $h(v) = 4|v-1/2-1/4| = 4|v-3/4|$.\n\nLet's evaluate $h(v)$ at some key points:\n$h(0)=4|1/4|=1$.\n$h(1/4)=0$.\n$h(1/2)=4|1/4-1/2|=1$.\n$h(3/4)=0$.\n$h(1)=4|1-3/4|=1$.\nThe graph of $h(v)$ for $v \\in [0,1]$ is a \"W\" shape with peaks at $(0,1), (1/2,1), (1,1)$ and valleys at $(1/4,0), (3/4,0)$. A \"lobe\" can be considered as the part of the graph between two consecutive peaks (e.g., from $v=0$ to $v=1/2$). So, $h(v)$ has 2 lobes on $[0,1]$.\n\nLet $F(x) = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ and $G(y) = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$. We need to find the number of intersections of the graphs of $y=F(x)$ and $x=G(y)$. This is equivalent to finding the number of solutions to the system, which is also the number of solutions to $x = G(F(x))$ or $y=F(G(y))$. Let's count the solutions for $y \\in [0,1]$ from $y=F(G(y))$.\n\nLet's determine the number of \"lobes\" of $F(x)$ and $G(y)$ on the interval $[0,1]$. A lobe here will be the portion of the graph between two consecutive points where the function value is 1.\nFor $y=F(x)=h(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)$:\nThe function $v(x)=|\\sin(2\\pi x)|$ has period $1/2$. In one period, say $x \\in [0, 1/2]$, $v(x)$ goes from 0 to 1 and back to 0.\nAs $v$ goes from 0 to 1, $h(v)$ completes its \"W\" shape, which has 2 lobes. As $v$ goes from 1 to 0, $h(v)$ traces the \"W\" shape in reverse, for another 2 lobes.\nSo, in $[0, 1/2]$, $F(x)$ has $2 \\times 2 = 4$ lobes.\nSince the period of $F(x)$ is $1/2$, in $[0,1]$, $F(x)$ has $2 \\times 4 = 8$ lobes.\n\nFor $x=G(y)=h(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|)$:\nThe function $v(y)=|\\cos(3\\pi y)|$ has period $1/3$. In one period, say $y \\in [0, 1/3]$, $v(y)$ goes from 1 to 0 and back to 1.\nAs $v$ goes from 1 to 0, $h(v)$ traces the \"W\" shape backwards, which is 2 lobes. As $v$ goes from 0 to 1, $h(v)$ traces it forwards, another 2 lobes.\nSo, in $[0, 1/3]$, $G(y)$ has $2+2=4$ lobes.\nSince the period of $G(y)$ is $1/3$, in $[0,1]$, $G(y)$ has $3 \\times 4 = 12$ lobes.\n\nWe are looking for the number of solutions to $y=F(G(y))$. Let $\\Phi(y) = F(G(y))$. We are counting the intersections of the graph of $z=\\Phi(y)$ with the line $z=y$.\n\nLet's determine the number of lobes of $\\Phi(y)=F(G(y))$ for $y \\in [0,1]$.\nThe function $G(y)$ has 12 lobes on $[0,1]$. A lobe of $G(y)$ is a part of the graph between two consecutive points $(y_i, 1)$ and $(y_{i+1}, 1)$. Within such a lobe, the value of $x=G(y)$ goes from 1 down to 0 and back up to 1.\nLet's analyze what $F(x)$ does for $x$ going from 1 to 0 and back to 1.\nAs $x$ goes from 1 to 0, $F(x)$ traces its graph backwards from $x=1$ to $x=0$. The graph of $F(x)$ on $[0,1]$ has 8 lobes. So, this traces 8 lobes.\nAs $x$ goes from 0 to 1, $F(x)$ traces its graph forwards, which is another 8 lobes.\nSo, for each lobe of $G(y)$, the function $\\Phi(y)=F(G(y))$ completes $8+8=16$ lobes.\nSince $G(y)$ has 12 lobes on $[0,1]$, the function $\\Phi(y)$ has $12 \\times 16 = 192$ lobes.\n\nNow we need to count the number of solutions to $\\Phi(y)=y$.\nLet's check the values at the endpoints.\n$\\Phi(0) = F(G(0)) = F(H(\\cos(0))) = F(H(1)) = F(1) = H(\\sin(2\\pi)) = H(0) = 1$.\n$\\Phi(1) = F(G(1)) = F(H(\\cos(3\\pi))) = F(H(-1)) = F(1) = H(\\sin(2\\pi)) = H(0) = 1$.\nThe graph of $z=\\Phi(y)$ starts at $(0,1)$ and ends at $(1,1)$.\nThe line $z=y$ starts at $(0,0)$ and ends at $(1,1)$.\nA lobe of $\\Phi(y)$ is a part of the graph that goes from a value of 1, down to 0, and back to 1.\nLet's consider one of the 192 lobes of $\\Phi(y)$. Let it be on the interval $[y_a, y_b]$.\n$\\Phi(y_a)=1$ and $\\Phi(y_b)=1$. For some $y_m \\in (y_a, y_b)$, $\\Phi(y_m)=0$.\nThe line $z=y$ has value $y_a$ at $y_a$ and $y_b$ at $y_b$.\nSince $y=0$ is not a solution ($\\Phi(0)=1$), and $y=1$ is a solution, all other solutions must be in $(0,1)$.\nThe values $y_a, y_b$ are in $[0,1]$.\nAt $y_a$, $\\Phi(y_a)=1 > y_a$ (unless $y_a=1$).\nAt $y_m$, $\\Phi(y_m)=0 < y_m$ (since $y_m>0$).\nBy the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be at least one solution in $(y_a, y_m)$.\nSimilarly, at $y_b$, $\\Phi(y_b)=1 > y_b$ (unless $y_b=1$), so there must be at least one solution in $(y_m, y_b)$.\nSince the function $\\Phi(y)$ is monotonic on $[y_a, y_m]$ (going down) and on $[y_m, y_b]$ (going up), there is exactly one solution on each of these segments.\nSo, each lobe of $\\Phi(y)$ that is not at the very end $y=1$ will intersect the line $z=y$ exactly twice.\n\nLet's analyze the situation at $y=1$. The point $(1,1)$ is an intersection point, since $\\Phi(1)=1$.\nThe last lobe of $\\Phi(y)$ ends at $y=1$. Let's see if it intersects the line $z=y$ elsewhere.\nLet's check the derivative of $\\Phi(y)$ at $y=1$.\n$\\Phi'(y) = F'(G(y)) G'(y)$.\nThe peaks of $G(y)$ are at $y$ where $|\\cos(3\\pi y)| \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$. At these points (if not endpoints 0,1), the derivative is zero. $y=1$ is such a point.\nThe derivative of $G(y)$ at $y=1$ is 0. Thus, $\\Phi'(1)=0$.\nThe line $z=y$ has a slope of 1 at $y=1$.\nNear $y=1$, let $y=1-\\epsilon$ for $\\epsilon>0$ small.\n$\\Phi(1)=1$. The line is $z=1$.\n$\\Phi(1-\\epsilon) < 1$ and $y=1-\\epsilon < 1$.\nWe can show $\\Phi(1-\\epsilon) > 1-\\epsilon$ for small $\\epsilon$.\n$\\Phi(1-\\epsilon) = F(G(1-\\epsilon))$.\n$G(1-\\epsilon) = H(\\cos(3\\pi-3\\pi\\epsilon)) = H(-\\cos(3\\pi\\epsilon)) = H(\\cos(3\\pi\\epsilon)) \\approx H(1-(3\\pi\\epsilon)^2/2) = h(1-(3\\pi\\epsilon)^2/2) = 4|1-(3\\pi\\epsilon)^2/2 - 3/4| = 1-18\\pi^2\\epsilon^2$.\n$F(1-18\\pi^2\\epsilon^2) = H(\\sin(2\\pi(1-18\\pi^2\\epsilon^2))) = H(-\\sin(36\\pi^3\\epsilon^2)) \\approx h(36\\pi^3\\epsilon^2) = 4|1/4-36\\pi^3\\epsilon^2| = 1-144\\pi^3\\epsilon^2$.\nWe are comparing $\\Phi(1-\\epsilon) \\approx 1-144\\pi^3\\epsilon^2$ with $y=1-\\epsilon$.\nFor small $\\epsilon>0$, $144\\pi^3\\epsilon^2 < \\epsilon$, so $1-144\\pi^3\\epsilon^2 > 1-\\epsilon$.\nSo $\\Phi(y)>y$ for $y$ just below 1.\nThe minimum of the last lobe is 0, at some $y_m<1$. $\\Phi(y_m)=0 < y_m$.\nSo there must be another intersection point for the last lobe in $(y_m, 1)$.\nThis means even the last lobe provides two solutions.\n\nSo, each of the 192 lobes of $z=\\Phi(y)$ intersects the line $z=y$ twice.\nTotal number of solutions is $192 \\times 2 = 384$.\nEach solution $y^*$ corresponds to a unique intersection point $(x^*, y^*)$, where $x^*=G(y^*)$. We must check that this point is on the first curve: $y^*=F(x^*)$.\n$y^* = \\Phi(y^*) = F(G(y^*)) = F(x^*)$. So this is satisfied.\nThe number of intersections is the number of solutions for $y$.\n\nFinal count:\nNumber of lobes of $F(x)$ in $[0,1]$ is $L_F = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$.\nNumber of lobes of $G(y)$ in $[0,1]$ is $L_G = 3 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 12$.\nNumber of lobes of $\\Phi(y) = F(G(y))$ is $L_\\Phi = L_G \\times (2 L_F) = 12 \\times (2 \\times 8) = 192$.\nEach lobe of $\\Phi(y)$ gives 2 intersections with $z=y$.\nTotal intersections = $192 \\times 2 = 384$.\n\n"

For such $t$, $|t| \\in [0,1]$.\nThe range of $f(t)$ for $t \\in [-1,1]$ is $[0, 1/2]$. Let $u=f(t)$.\n$g(u) = ||u|-\\frac{1}{4}|$. Since $u \\in [0,1/2]$, $|u|=u$, so $g(u) = |u-\\frac{1}{4}|$.\nTherefore, $H(t) = 4|f(t) - \\frac{1}{4}| = 4|||t|-\\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4}|$.\nThe equations become $y = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ and $x = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$.\n\nThe function $H(t)$ is an even function, since it depends only on $|t|$. So we can write $y = H(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)$ and $x = H(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|)$.\nLet's analyze the shape of $H(t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$.\n$H(t) = 4||t-\\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4}|$.\n- If $t \\in [0, 1/2]$, $H(t) = 4|\\frac{1}{2}-t-\\frac{1}{4}| = 4|\\frac{1}{4}-t|$.\n  - For $t \\in [0, 1/4]$, $H(t) = 4(\\frac{1}{4}-t) = 1-4t$.\n  - For $t \\in [1/4, 1/2]$, $H(t) = 4(t-\\frac{1}{4}) = 4t-1$.\n- If $t \\in [1/2, 1]$, $H(t) = 4|t-\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{4}| = 4|t-\\frac{3}{4}|$.\n  - For $t \\in [1/2, 3/4]$, $H(t) = 4(\\frac{3}{4}-t) = 3-4t$.\n  - For $t \\in [3/4, 1]$, $H(t) = 4(t-\\frac{3}{4}) = 4t-3$.\n\nThe graph of $H(t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ starts at $H(0)=1$, goes down to $H(1/4)=0$, up to $H(1/2)=1$, down to $H(3/4)=0$, and up to $H(1)=1$. This \"W-W\" shape consists of 4 monotonic segments (strands).\n\nLet's analyze the graph of $y = H(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)$ for $x \\in [0,1]$.\nLet $S(x) = |\\sin(2\\pi x)|$. $S(x)$ is periodic with period $1/2$.\nIn the interval $x \\in [0, 1/4]$, $S(x) = \\sin(2\\pi x)$ increases from 0 to 1.\nIn the interval $x \\in [1/4, 1/2]$, $S(x) = \\sin(2\\pi x)$ decreases from 1 to 0.\nThe graph of $y(x)$ for $x \\in [0,1/4]$ is a horizontally scaled version of the graph of $H(t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$. Thus, it consists of 4 monotonic pieces.\nSimilarly, for $x \\in [1/4, 1/2]$, the graph of $y(x)$ is a reflection of the previous part and also has 4 monotonic pieces.\nSo, in one period $[0, 1/2]$ of $S(x)$, the graph of $y(x)$ has $2 \\times 4 = 8$ monotonic pieces.\nSince $x \\in [0,1]$, which covers two periods of $S(x)$, the graph of $y(x)$ consists of $8 \\times 2 = 16$ monotonic pieces. Each piece, called a \"strand\", represents the graph of $y(x)$ going from $y=0$ to $y=1$ or vice-versa.\n\nNow, let's analyze the graph of $x = H(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|)$ for $y \\in [0,1]$.\nLet $C(y) = |\\cos(3\\pi y)|$. $C(y)$ is periodic with period $1/3$.\nIn the interval $y \\in [0, 1/6]$, $C(y) = \\cos(3\\pi y)$ decreases from 1 to 0.\nIn the interval $y \\in [1/6, 1/3]$, $C(y) = |\\cos(3\\pi y)|$ increases from 0 to 1.\nSimilar to the analysis for $y(x)$, for $y \\in [0,1/3]$, the graph of $x(y)$ consists of $2 \\times 4 = 8$ monotonic pieces.\nSince $y \\in [0,1]$, which covers three periods of $C(y)$, the graph of $x(y)$ consists of $8 \\times 3 = 24$ monotonic pieces (strands). Each strand represents the graph of $x(y)$ going from $x=0$ to $x=1$ or vice-versa.\n\nWe need to find the number of intersections of these two graphs in the square $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$.\nThe graph of $y=H(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)$ is a single curve composed of 16 strands. Each strand is a monotonic curve connecting the line $y=0$ to the line $y=1$.\nThe graph of $x=H(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|)$ is a single curve composed of 24 strands. Each strand is a monotonic curve connecting the line $x=0$ to the line $x=1$.\n\nLet's consider one strand of the first graph, say $G_{y,i}$ for $i \\in \\{1, ..., 16\\}$, and one strand of the second graph, $G_{x,j}$ for $j \\in \\{1, ..., 24\\}$.\n$G_{y,i}$ is the graph of $y(x)$ on some interval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$ where $y(x)$ is monotonic, with $\\{y(x_{i-1}), y(x_i)\\} = \\{0,1\\}$.\n$G_{x,j}$ is the graph of $x(y)$ on some interval $[y_{j-1}, y_j]$ where $x(y)$ is monotonic, with $\\{x(y_{j-1}), x(y_j)\\} = \\{0,1\\}$.\n\nTopologically, $G_{y,i}$ is a path connecting the top and bottom boundaries of the unit square. $G_{x,j}$ is a path connecting the left and right boundaries of the unit square. Such a pair of paths must intersect at least once.\nGiven the smooth nature of the sine, cosine, and piecewise linear function $H$, it is reasonable to assume that each pair of strands intersects exactly once.\nThe total number of intersections is the product of the number of strands of each graph.\nNumber of strands for $y(x)$ is 16.\nNumber of strands for $x(y)$ is 24.\nTotal number of intersections = $16 \\times 24$.\n$16 \\times 24 = 16 \\times (20 + 4) = 320 + 64 = 384$.\n\nWe should check if any intersection points are shared among multiple pairs of strands. This could happen if strands meet at their endpoints. An endpoint of a $y$-strand lies on the lines $y=0$ or $y=1$. An endpoint of an $x$-strand lies on $x=0$ or $x=1$. A shared endpoint would have to be one of the four corners of the unit square.\nLet's check the corners:\n- $(0,0)$: For $y(x)$, $y(0)=H(0)=1 \\ne 0$. Not on the graph.\n- $(0,1)$: For $y(x)$, $y(0)=H(0)=1$. Point is on the graph. For $x(y)$, $x(1)=H(|\\cos(3\\pi)|)=H(1)=1 \\ne 0$. Not on the graph.\n- $(1,0)$: For $y(x)$, $y(1)=H(0)=1 \\ne 0$. Not on the graph.\n- $(1,1)$: For $y(x)$, $y(1)=H(0)=1$. Point is on the graph. For $x(y)$, $x(1)=H(1)=1$. Point is on the graph.\nSo, $(1,1)$ is an intersection point. This point is an endpoint for a strand of $y(x)$ (specifically, the last one, from $x$ where $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|=1/4$ to $x=1$) and for a strand of $x(y)$ (the last one, from $y$ where $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|=1/4$ to $y=1$). Since it is a common endpoint for exactly one pair of strands, no overcounting occurs from this single case.\n\nThe argument that each of the 16 vertical strands intersects each of the 24 horizontal strands exactly once is plausible for such non-pathological functions.\n\nFinal calculation: $16 \\times 24 = 384$.\n\n"

"Let the two given equations be\n(1) $y = 4 g(f(\\sin (2 \\pi x)))$\n(2) $x = 4 g(f(\\cos (3 \\pi y)))$\n\nFirst, let's analyze the function $H(u) = 4g(f(u))$.\nThe functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are defined as $f(x)=|| x|-\\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\\tfrac{1}{4}|$.\nSo, $H(u) = 4g(f(u)) = 4||f(u)|-\\tfrac{1}{4}|$.\nSince $f(u) = ||u|-\\tfrac{1}{2}|$, its range is $[0, \\infty)$, so $|f(u)|=f(u)$.\n$H(u) = 4| ||u|-\\tfrac{1}{2}| - \\tfrac{1}{4} |$.\nThe equations become:\n(1) $y = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$\n(2) $x = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$\n\nThe inputs to $H$ are $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ and $\\cos(3\\pi y)$, which are in the interval $[-1, 1]$.\nLet's analyze the behavior of $H(u)$ for $u \\in [-1, 1]$.\nThe range of $H(u)$ can be determined. The maximum value of $u$ is 1.\n$H(1) = 4|||1|-\\tfrac{1}{2}| - \\tfrac{1}{4}| = 4|\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\tfrac{1}{4}| = 4(\\tfrac{1}{4}) = 1$.\n$H(0) = 4|||0|-\\tfrac{1}{2}| - \\tfrac{1}{4}| = 4|\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\tfrac{1}{4}| = 1$.\n$H(1/2) = 4|||1/2|-\\tfrac{1}{2}| - \\tfrac{1}{4}| = 4|0 - \\tfrac{1}{4}| = 1$.\nThe minimum value of $H(u)$ is 0, which occurs when $||u|-\\tfrac{1}{2}| = \\tfrac{1}{4}$. This means $|u|-\\tfrac{1}{2} = \\pm\\tfrac{1}{4}$, so $|u| = \\tfrac{3}{4}$ or $|u| = \\tfrac{1}{4}$.\nSo, for $u \\in [-1, 1]$, the range of $H(u)$ is $[0, 1]$.\nFrom equation (1), $y$ must be in $[0, 1]$. From equation (2), $x$ must be in $[0, 1]$. We are looking for intersections in the unit square $[0, 1] \\times [0, 1]$.\n\nLet's analyze the graph of $y = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ for $x \\in [0, 1]$.\nLet $u = \\sin(2\\pi x)$. As $x$ goes from 0 to 1, $u$ goes from 0 to 1, then to 0, then to -1, and back to 0.\nLet's analyze the graph of $H(u)$ for $u \\in [-1, 1]$.\n$H(u)$ is an even function. For $u \\in [0, 1]$, the graph of $H(u)$ starts at $H(0)=1$, goes down to $H(1/4)=0$, up to $H(1/2)=1$, down to $H(3/4)=0$, and up to $H(1)=1$. This forms two \"V\" shapes, which we can call a \"W\" shape.\nThe graph of $H(u)$ for $u \\in [-1, 0]$ is a mirror image of the graph for $u \\in [0, 1]$.\nSo, the graph of $H(u)$ for $u \\in [-1, 1]$ consists of four \"V\" shapes.\n\nThe graph of $y(x) = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ for $x \\in [0, 1]$ is generated as follows:\n1. For $x \\in [0, 1/4]$, $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ goes from 0 to 1. $y(x)$ traces the graph of $H(u)$ for $u \\in [0, 1]$, which consists of two V-shapes.\n2. For $x \\in [1/4, 1/2]$, $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ goes from 1 to 0. $y(x)$ traces the same graph backwards, another two V-shapes.\n3. For $x \\in [1/2, 3/4]$, $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ goes from 0 to -1. $y(x)$ traces the graph of $H(u)$ for $u \\in [0, -1]$, another two V-shapes.\n4. For $x \\in [3/4, 1]$, $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ goes from -1 to 0. $y(x)$ traces this graph backwards, another two V-shapes.\nIn total, the graph of $y=H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ for $x \\in [0, 1]$ consists of $2+2+2+2=8$ V-shapes. Each V-shape is composed of two linear segments. So the graph $C_1$ has $8 \\times 2 = 16$ monotonic segments. Each V-shape goes from a peak ($y=1$) to a valley ($y=0$) and back to a peak.\n\nNow, let's analyze the graph of $x = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$ for $y \\in [0, 1]$.\nLet $v = \\cos(3\\pi y)$. As $y$ goes from 0 to 1, $3\\pi y$ goes from 0 to $3\\pi$. The value of $v$ goes from $\\cos(0)=1$ to $\\cos(\\pi)=-1$, then to $\\cos(2\\pi)=1$, and finally to $\\cos(3\\pi)=-1$.\nThe graph of $x(y) = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$ is generated as follows:\n1. For $y \\in [0, 1/3]$, $v=\\cos(3\\pi y)$ goes from 1 to -1. The graph of $x(y)$ traces out the graph of $H(v)$ for $v \\in [1, -1]$. This consists of 4 V-shapes (sideways).\n2. For $y \\in [1/3, 2/3]$, $v$ goes from -1 to 1. The graph of $x(y)$ traces $H(v)$ from $v=-1$ to $v=1$, another 4 V-shapes.\n3. For $y \\in [2/3, 1]$, $v$ goes from 1 to -1. The graph of $x(y)$ traces $H(v)$ from $v=1$ to $v=-1$, another 4 V-shapes.\nIn total, the graph of $x=H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$ for $y \\in [0, 1]$ consists of $4+4+4=12$ sideways V-shapes. The graph $C_2$ has $12 \\times 2 = 24$ monotonic segments.\n\nWe need to find the number of intersections of these two graphs, $C_1$ and $C_2$, in the square $[0, 1] \\times [0, 1]$.\nLet's use a topological argument. The graph $C_1$ consists of 8 V-shapes. The peaks of these V-shapes are at $y=1$ and the valleys are at $y=0$. A segment going from a peak to a valley is a continuous path from the line $y=1$ to the line $y=0$. A segment going from a valley to a peak is a continuous path from $y=0$ to $y=1$. There are 8 such \"downward\" paths and 8 \"upward\" paths in $C_1$.\n\nSimilarly, the graph $C_2$ consists of 12 sideways V-shapes. The \"peaks\" (rightmost points) are at $x=1$ and the \"valleys\" (leftmost points) are at $x=0$. A segment going from $x=1$ to $x=0$ is a \"leftward\" path. A segment going from $x=0$ to $x=1$ is a \"rightward\" path. There are 12 such leftward paths and 12 rightward paths in $C_2$.\n\nConsider one downward path of $C_1$. It is a continuous curve connecting the top edge ($y=1$) of the unit square to the bottom edge ($y=0$).\nConsider one leftward path of $C_2$. It is a continuous curve connecting the right edge ($x=1$) of the unit square to the left edge ($x=0$).\nBy the Intermediate Value Theorem, these two paths must intersect at least once. Since the paths are straight line segments, they intersect exactly once.\n\nLet's count the intersections based on the type of segments:\n1.  Each of the 8 downward segments of $C_1$ must intersect each of the 12 leftward segments of $C_2$. This gives $8 \\times 12 = 96$ intersections.\n2.  Each of the 8 downward segments of $C_1$ must intersect each of the 12 rightward segments of $C_2$. This gives $8 \\times 12 = 96$ intersections.\n3.  Each of the 8 upward segments of $C_1$ must intersect each of the 12 leftward segments of $C_2$. This gives $8 \\times 12 = 96$ intersections.\n4.  Each of the 8 upward segments of $C_1$ must intersect each of the 12 rightward segments of $C_2$. This gives $8 \\times 12 = 96$ intersections.\n\nThe total number of intersections is the sum of these counts: $96 + 96 + 96 + 96 = 4 \\times 96 = 384$.\n\nWe need to ensure that these intersections are all distinct. An intersection point could lie on the junction of two segments (a vertex).\nLet's check the vertices of the graphs.\nA vertex of $C_1$ is a point $(x,y)$ where the slope of $y(x)$ is undefined. This occurs when $y=0$ or $y=1$.\n- If a vertex is at $y=1$, then $H(\\sin(2\\pi x))=1$. For this point to be on $C_2$, we must have $x = H(\\cos(3\\pi \\cdot 1)) = H(-1) = 1$. So $x=1$. The point is $(1,1)$.\n- If a vertex is at $y=0$, then $H(\\sin(2\\pi x))=0$. For this point to be on $C_2$, we must have $x = H(\\cos(3\\pi \\cdot 0)) = H(1) = 1$. So the point is $(1,0)$. But for $y=0$, $H(\\sin(2\\pi x))=0$, so $\\sin(2\\pi x) \\in \\{\\pm 1/4, \\pm 3/4\\}$. None of these give $x=1$. So no vertex of $C_1$ at $y=0$ lies on $C_2$.\n\nA vertex of $C_2$ is a point $(x,y)$ where $x=0$ or $x=1$.\n- If a vertex is at $x=1$, then $H(\\cos(3\\pi y))=1$. For this point to be on $C_1$, we must have $y = H(\\sin(2\\pi \\cdot 1)) = H(0) = 1$. So $y=1$. The point is $(1,1)$.\n- If a vertex is at $x=0$, then $H(\\cos(3\\pi y))=0$. For this point to be on $C_1$, we must have $y = H(\\sin(2\\pi \\cdot 0)) = H(0) = 1$. So the point is $(0,1)$. But for $x=0$, $H(\\cos(3\\pi y))=0$, so $\\cos(3\\pi y) \\in \\{\\pm 1/4, \\pm 3/4\\}$. None of these give $y=1$. So no vertex of $C_2$ at $x=0$ lies on $C_1$.\n\nThe only vertex that is an intersection point is $(1,1)$.\nThe argument based on segment crossings counts the number of times an open segment of $C_1$ crosses an open segment of $C_2$. The vertices are the endpoints of these segments.\nThe point $(1,1)$ is an endpoint for the last segment of $C_1$ and the last segment of $C_2$.\nThe last upward segment of $C_1$ connects a point $(x_v, 0)$ to $(1,1)$.\nThe last rightward segment of $C_2$ connects a point $(0, y_v)$ to $(1,1)$.\nThese two segments intersect at $(1,1)$. This intersection is included in the count of (upward, rightward) intersections.\nThe argument holds. Each pair of segments, one from $C_1$ and one from $C_2$, intersects exactly once. The total number of intersections is the product of the number of segments of $C_1$ and the number of segments of $C_2$, divided by type.\nNumber of intersections = (Number of $C_1$ downward segments $\\times$ Number of $C_2$ segments) + (Number of $C_1$ upward segments $\\times$ Number of $C_2$ segments)\n$= 8 \\times 24 + 8 \\times 24 = 16 \\times 24 = 384$.\nAlternatively, (Number of $C_2$ leftward segments $\\times$ Number of $C_1$ segments) + (Number of $C_2$ rightward segments $\\times$ Number of $C_1$ segments)\n$= 12 \\times 16 + 12 \\times 16 = 24 \\times 16 = 384$.\n\nThe number of intersections is the number of V-shapes of $C_1$ (8) times the number of V-shapes of $C_2$ (12) times 4 intersections per pair of V-shapes.\n$8 \\times 12 \\times 4 = 384$.\n\n"

This shape, which consists of four linear segments, can be described as a \"M\" or a double \"V\" shape. Since $H(t)$ is even, the graph for $t \\in [-1, 0]$ is a mirror image. The range of $H(t)$ for $t \\in [-1,1]$ is $[0,1]$.\n\nThe equations become:\n(1) $y = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ for $x \\in [0, 1]$ (since $x$ must be in the range of $H$, which is $[0,1]$).\n(2) $x = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$ for $y \\in [0, 1]$ (since $y$ must be in the range of $H$, which is $[0,1]$).\n\nLet's analyze the graph of $C_1: y = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ in the unit square $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$.\nThe graph of $y(x)$ has turning points when the argument of $H$, $t=\\sin(2\\pi x)$, takes values where $H(t)$ has turning points, i.e., $t \\in \\{0, \\pm 1/4, \\pm 1/2, \\pm 3/4, \\pm 1\\}$.\nThe local maxima of $y(x)$ are $y=1$, which occurs when $H(\\sin(2\\pi x))=1$. This happens when $|\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$.\n- $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|=0 \\implies x \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$. (3 points)\n- $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|=1/2 \\implies x \\in \\{1/12, 5/12, 7/12, 11/12\\}$. (4 points)\n- $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|=1 \\implies x \\in \\{1/4, 3/4\\}$. (2 points)\nTotal number of points where $y=1$ is $3+4+2=9$.\nThe local minima of $y(x)$ are $y=0$, which occurs when $|\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\in \\{1/4, 3/4\\}$.\n- $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|=1/4$: 4 solutions for $x \\in (0,1)$.\n- $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|=3/4$: 4 solutions for $x \\in (0,1)$.\nTotal number of points where $y=0$ is $4+4=8$.\nThe graph of $C_1$ from $x=0$ to $x=1$ is a sequence of monotonic segments connecting these points. The number of monotonic segments is the number of maxima plus the number of minima, minus one. So, $9+8-1=16$ segments. These 16 segments form 8 \"V-shapes\" or valleys.\n\nLet's analyze the graph of $C_2: x = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$ in the unit square.\nThe local maxima of $x(y)$ are $x=1$, which occurs when $|\\cos(3\\pi y)| \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$.\n- $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|=0 \\implies y \\in \\{1/6, 1/2, 5/6\\}$. (3 points)\n- $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|=1/2 \\implies y \\in \\{1/9, 2/9, 4/9, 5/9, 7/9, 8/9\\}$. (6 points)\n- $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|=1 \\implies y \\in \\{0, 1/3, 2/3, 1\\}$. (4 points)\nTotal number of points where $x=1$ is $3+6+4=13$.\nThe local minima of $x(y)$ are $x=0$, which occurs when $|\\cos(3\\pi y)| \\in \\{1/4, 3/4\\}$.\n- $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|=1/4$: 6 solutions for $y \\in (0,1)$.\n- $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|=3/4$: 6 solutions for $y \\in (0,1)$.\nTotal number of points where $x=0$ is $6+6=12$.\nThe graph of $C_2$ from $y=0$ to $y=1$ consists of $13+12-1=24$ monotonic segments. These 24 segments form 12 horizontal \"V-shapes\".\n\nWe need to find the number of intersections of $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n$C_1$ is composed of 16 monotonic arcs, let's call them $V_1, \\dots, V_{16}$. The endpoints of these arcs are the points where $y=0$ or $y=1$.\n$C_2$ is composed of 24 monotonic arcs, $H_1, \\dots, H_{24}$. The endpoints of these arcs are the points where $x=0$ or $x=1$.\n\nLet's consider one arc $V_i$ and one arc $H_j$.\nAn arc $V_i$ connects a point on $y=y_a$ to a point on $y=y_b$, where $y_a, y_b \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and $y_a \\ne y_b$. Let's say $V_i$ is on the interval $[x_1, x_2]$. Its bounding box is $[x_1, x_2] \\times [0,1]$.\nAn arc $H_j$ connects a point on $x=x_c$ to a point on $x=x_d$, where $x_c, x_d \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and $x_c \\ne x_d$. Let's say $H_j$ is on the interval $[y_1, y_2]$. Its bounding box is $[0,1] \\times [y_1, y_2]$.\nThe intersection of their bounding boxes is $R_{ij} = [x_1, x_2] \\times [y_1, y_2]$.\nThe arc $V_i$ is a monotonic curve (in $y$) that crosses $R_{ij}$ from top to bottom (or vice versa).\nThe arc $H_j$ is a monotonic curve (in $x$) that crosses $R_{ij}$ from left to right (or vice versa).\nBy the Intermediate Value Theorem, these two arcs must intersect inside $R_{ij}$. Since both arcs are graphs of monotonic functions within the box (one $y(x)$, the other $x(y)$), they intersect exactly once.\n\nSo, each of the 16 monotonic arcs of $C_1$ intersects each of the 24 monotonic arcs of $C_2$. This gives a total of $16 \\times 24 = 384$ intersection points, provided that these points are all distinct.\n\nThe intersection points could coincide if they occur at the endpoints of the arcs.\nThe endpoints of the $V_i$ arcs are the points on $C_1$ where $y=0$ or $y=1$.\nThe endpoints of the $H_j$ arcs are the points on $C_2$ where $x=0$ or $x=1$.\nAn intersection point is a common endpoint if it lies on $\\{y=0,1\\}$ and $\\{x=0,1\\}$, i.e., it is one of the four corners of the unit square.\n- $(0,0)$: $y(0)=H(0)=1 \\ne 0$. Not on $C_1$.\n- $(0,1)$: $y(0)=H(0)=1$. This point is on $C_1$. For it to be on $C_2$, we need $0 = H(\\cos(3\\pi \\cdot 1)) = H(-1)=1$, which is false.\n- $(1,0)$: $x(0)=H(1)=1 \\ne 0$. Not on $C_2$.\n- $(1,1)$: $y(1)=H(0)=1$. This point is on $C_1$. $x(1)=H(\\cos(3\\pi))=H(-1)=1$. This point is on $C_2$.\nSo, $(1,1)$ is the only corner point that is an intersection. This point is an endpoint for the last arc of $C_1$ ($V_{16}$) and the last arc of $C_2$ ($H_{24}$).\n\nAn intersection point could also be an endpoint of an arc of one curve and an interior point of an arc of the other. For example, a point $(x_0, 1)$, an endpoint for two $V$ arcs, could lie on an $H_j$ arc.\nFor this to happen, $x_0 = H(\\cos(3\\pi \\cdot 1)) = H(-1) = 1$. So $x_0=1$. This again leads to $(1,1)$.\nA point $(x_0, 0)$ on $C_1$ would require $x_0 = H(\\cos(3\\pi \\cdot 0)) = H(1) = 1$. But the $x$-coordinates of the $y=0$ points for $C_1$ are not 1.\nA point $(0, y_0)$ on $C_2$ would require $0 = H(\\sin(2\\pi \\cdot 0)) = H(0) = 1$, impossible.\nA point $(1, y_0)$ on $C_2$ would require $1 = H(\\sin(2\\pi \\cdot 1)) = H(0) = 1$. This is true for any $y_0$ for which $(1,y_0)$ is a vertex of $C_2$. The vertices are at $y \\in \\{0, 1/9, \\dots, 1\\}$. So all points $(1,y_j)$ where $x(y_j)=1$ are on the line $x=1$, and the curve $C_1$ passes through $y=H(\\sin(2\\pi \\cdot 1))=1$. So only $(1,1)$ is an intersection point on the boundary lines $x=0,1, y=0,1$.\n\nThe intersection point of $V_i$ and $H_j$ is unique to this pair of arcs, unless it is a shared vertex.\nWe've established that the only shared vertex is $(1,1)$.\nThe intersection of $V_{16}$ and $H_{24}$ is the point $(1,1)$.\nAll other pairs of arcs $(V_i, H_j)$ intersect at a point that is not a vertex for either curve.\nAn intersection point $P$ cannot be on two different $V$ arcs, as they do not intersect (they are part of a graph of a function $y(x)$). Similarly, $P$ cannot be on two different $H$ arcs.\nTherefore, each of the $16 \\times 24$ pairs of arcs corresponds to a unique intersection point.\n\nThe number of intersections is $16 \\times 24 = 384$.\n\n"

"Let the two given equations be\n(1) $y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))$\n(2) $x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))$\n\nFirst, let's analyze the functions $f(x)=||x|-\\frac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=||x|-\\frac{1}{4}|$.\nLet's define a composite function $H(t) = 4g(f(t))$.\nLet $u=f(t) = ||t|-\\frac{1}{2}|$.\nThen $H(t) = 4g(u) = 4||u|-\\frac{1}{4}|$.

For $t \\in [-1, 1]$, $s \\in [0, 1]$.\n$H(t)$ is an even function, so we only need to analyze it for $s \\in [0, 1]$. Let's call this function $T(s) = 4||s-\\frac{1}{2}|-\\frac{1}{4}|$ for $s \\in [0,1]$.\nThe equations are $y = T(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)$ and $x = T(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|)$.\n\nLet's analyze $T(s)$ for $s \\in [0,1]$.\n- If $s \\in [0, 1/2]$, $|s-1/2| = 1/2-s$. $T(s) = 4|1/2-s-1/4| = 4|1/4-s|$.\n-- For $s \\in [0, 1/4]$, $T(s) = 4(1/4-s) = 1-4s$.\n-- For $s \\in [1/4, 1/2]$, $T(s) = 4(s-1/4) = 4s-1$.\n- If $s \\in [1/2, 1]$, $|s-1/2| = s-1/2$. $T(s) = 4|s-1/2-1/4| = 4|s-3/4|$.\n-- For $s \\in [1/2, 3/4]$, $T(s) = 4(3/4-s) = 3-4s$.\n-- For $s \\in [3/4, 1]$, $T(s) = 4(s-3/4) = 4s-3$.\n\nLet's check the values of $T(s)$ at critical points:\n$T(0)=1$, $T(1/4)=0$, $T(1/2)=1$, $T(3/4)=0$, $T(1)=1$.\nThe graph of $T(s)$ for $s \\in [0,1]$ consists of two V-shapes, one on $[0, 1/2]$ and another on $[1/2, 1]$. The range of $T(s)$ is $[0,1]$.\nFrom the equations, we can see that $x \\in [0,1]$ and $y \\in [0,1]$. So we are looking for intersections in the unit square $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$.\n\nLet $C_1$ be the graph of $y = T(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)$ and $C_2$ be the graph of $x = T(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|)$.\nWe need to find the number of intersection points of $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n\nLet's analyze the number of monotonic sections of each graph.\nFor $C_1$: $y(x) = T(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)$.\nThe function $s_1(x) = |\\sin(2\\pi x)|$ for $x \\in [0,1]$ has 4 monotonic sections:\n- $x \\in [0, 1/4]$, $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ goes from 0 to 1.\n- $x \\in [1/4, 1/2]$, $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ goes from 1 to 0.\n- $x \\in [1/2, 3/4]$, $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|$ goes from 0 to 1.\n- $x \\in [3/4, 1]$, $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|$ goes from 1 to 0.\nThe function $T(s)$ has 4 monotonic sections on $s \\in [0,1]$, corresponding to the intervals $[0,1/4], [1/4,1/2], [1/2,3/4], [3/4,1]$.\nThe composition $T(s_1(x))$ will have $4 \\times 4 = 16$ monotonic sections for $x \\in [0,1]$.\nLet's call the $x$-values that separate these sections $x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_{16}$, where $x_0=0, x_{16}=1$. These values correspond to $|\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\in \\{0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1\\}$.\nOn each interval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$, $y(x)$ is monotonic and its range is $[0,1]$.\n\nFor $C_2$: $x(y) = T(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|)$.\nThe function $s_2(y) = |\\cos(3\\pi y)|$ for $y \\in [0,1]$ has 6 monotonic sections:\n- $y \\in [0, 1/6]$, $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|$ goes from 1 to 0.\n- $y \\in [1/6, 1/3]$, $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|$ goes from 0 to 1.\n- $y \\in [1/3, 1/2]$, $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|$ goes from 1 to 0.\n- $y \\in [1/2, 2/3]$, $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|$ goes from 0 to 1.\n- $y \\in [2/3, 5/6]$, $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|$ goes from 1 to 0.\n- $y \\in [5/6, 1]$, $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|$ goes from 0 to 1.\nThe composition $T(s_2(y))$ will have $6 \\times 4 = 24$ monotonic sections for $y \\in [0,1]$.\nLet's call the $y$-values that separate these sections $y_0, y_1, \\dots, y_{24}$, where $y_0=0, y_{24}=1$. These values correspond to $|\\cos(3\\pi y)| \\in \\{0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1\\}$.\nOn each interval $[y_{j-1}, y_j]$, $x(y)$ is monotonic and its range is $[0,1]$.\n\nLet's consider the grid formed by the vertical lines $x=x_i$ for $i=0,\\dots,16$ and horizontal lines $y=y_j$ for $j=0,\\dots,24$. This grid has $16 \\times 24$ cells. Let a cell be $R_{ij} = [x_{i-1}, x_i] \\times [y_{j-1}, y_j]$.\n\nInside any such cell $R_{ij}$, let's analyze the graphs.\nLet $C_{1,i}$ be the part of $C_1$ for $x \\in [x_{i-1}, x_i]$. This is a monotonic curve connecting a point on a horizontal edge of the unit square (either $y=0$ or $y=1$) to a point on the other horizontal edge. For example, it might connect $(x_{i-1}, 0)$ to $(x_i, 1)$.\nLet $C_{2,j}$ be the part of $C_2$ for $y \\in [y_{j-1}, y_j]$. This is a monotonic curve connecting a point on a vertical edge of the unit square (either $x=0$ or $x=1$) to a point on the other vertical edge. For example, it might connect $(0, y_{j-1})$ to $(1, y_j)$.\n\nConsider the part of $C_{1,i}$ that lies within the horizontal strip $[0,1] \\times [y_{j-1}, y_j]$. Since the range of $y(x)$ on $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$ is $[0,1]$, there is a subinterval of $x$ values for which $y(x)$ is in $[y_{j-1}, y_j]$. This part of the curve, let's call it $C'_{1,i,j}$, is a continuous monotonic curve that connects the bottom edge of the cell, $y=y_{j-1}$, to the top edge, $y=y_j$.\nSimilarly, the part of $C_{2,j}$ within the vertical strip $[x_{i-1}, x_i] \\times [0,1]$, let's call it $C'_{2,i,j}$, is a continuous monotonic curve that connects the left edge of the cell, $x=x_{i-1}$, to the right edge, $x=x_i$.\n\nInside the cell $R_{ij}$, we have a monotonic curve $C'_{1,i,j}$ connecting the top and bottom boundaries and another monotonic curve $C'_{2,i,j}$ connecting the left and right boundaries. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, these two curves must intersect. Since one is a monotonic function of $x$ and the other is a monotonic function of $y$, their intersection inside the cell is unique.\n\nSo, there is exactly one intersection point inside each cell $R_{ij}$.\nThe total number of cells is $16 \\times 24 = 384$. This suggests there are 384 intersection points.\nWe need to check if any intersections lie on the boundaries of these cells (the grid lines) and if any points are double-counted.\n\nAn intersection point $(x_p, y_p)$ lies on a grid line if $x_p \\in \\{x_0, \\dots, x_{16}\\}$ or $y_p \\in \\{y_0, \\dots, y_{24}\\}$.\nIf $x_p = x_i$ for some $i$, then $|\\sin(2\\pi x_i)| \\in \\{0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1\\}$.\nThe value of $y(x_i)$ is $T(|\\sin(2\\pi x_i)|)$, which must be in $\\{0,1\\}$.\nSo, if an intersection point $(x_i, y_p)$ is on a vertical grid line, then $y_p$ must be 0 or 1.\n- If $y_p=0$, the condition for intersection is $x_i = x(0) = T(|\\cos(0)|) = T(1) = 1$. So the point is $(1,0)$. Let's check if $(1,0)$ is on $C_1$: $y(1) = T(|\\sin(2\\pi)|) = T(0) = 1$. Since $y(1)=1 \\neq 0$, $(1,0)$ is not an intersection point.\n- If $y_p=1$, the condition for intersection is $x_i = x(1) = T(|\\cos(3\\pi)|) = T(1) = 1$. So the point is $(1,1)$. Let's check if $(1,1)$ is on $C_1$: $y(1) = T(|\\sin(2\\pi)|) = T(0) = 1$. So $(1,1)$ is an intersection point.\n\nIf $y_p = y_j$ for some $j$, then $|\\cos(3\\pi y_j)| \\in \\{0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1\\}$.\nThe value of $x(y_j)$ is $T(|\\cos(3\\pi y_j)|)$, which must be in $\\{0,1\\}$.\nSo, if an intersection point $(x_p, y_j)$ is on a horizontal grid line, then $x_p$ must be 0 or 1.\n- If $x_p=0$, the condition for intersection is $y_j = y(0) = T(|\\sin(0)|) = T(0) = 1$. So the point is $(0,1)$. Let's check if $(0,1)$ is on $C_2$: $x(1) = T(|\\cos(3\\pi)|) = T(1) = 1$. Since $x(1)=1 \\neq 0$, $(0,1)$ is not an intersection point.\n- If $x_p=1$, the condition for intersection is $y_j = y(1) = T(|\\sin(2\\pi)|) = T(0) = 1$. So the point is $(1,1)$, which we already found.\n\nThe only intersection point that lies on a grid line is $(1,1)$.\nOur argument of a unique intersection \"inside\" each cell must be treated with care for the cells that have $(1,1)$ on their boundary.\nThe point $(1,1)$ is the top-right corner of the entire grid, corresponding to $(x_{16}, y_{24})$.\nThe cell $R_{16,24} = [x_{15}, x_{16}] \\times [y_{23}, y_{24}] = [x_{15}, 1] \\times [y_{23}, 1]$.\nThe monotonic curve $C_{1,16}$ on $[x_{15},1]$ connects $(x_{15},0)$ to $(1,1)$.\nThe monotonic curve $C_{2,24}$ on $[y_{23},1]$ connects $(0,y_{23})$ to $(1,1)$.\nThese two curves intersect at $(1,1)$. This is the unique intersection point for this cell $R_{16,24}$.\nFor any other cell $R_{ij}$, the intersection point cannot be on a boundary (since we showed that would imply the point is $(1,1)$). So for all other $16 \\times 24 - 1$ cells, the intersection point is in their interior.\nThus, each of the $16 \\times 24$ cells corresponds to exactly one unique intersection point.\nThe total number of intersection points is the total number of cells.\nNumber of intersections = (Number of monotonic sections of $y(x)$) $\\times$ (Number of monotonic sections of $x(y)$)\nNumber of intersections = $16 \\times 24 = 384$.\n\n"

"Let the two given equations be\n(1) $y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))$\n(2) $x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))$\n\nFirst, let's analyze the function $h(t) = 4g(f(t))$.\nThe definitions of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are $f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|$ and $g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|$.\nSo, $h(t) = 4|||t| - 1/2| - 1/4|$.\n\nThe arguments for $h$ in the given equations are $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ and $\\cos(3\\pi y)$. These values are in the interval $[-1, 1]$. So we only need to understand $h(t)$ for $t \\in [-1, 1]$.\nFor $t \\in [-1, 1]$, let $s = |t| \\in [0, 1]$. The function $h(t)$ is an even function, $h(t)=h(-t)$, and it can be written in terms of $s$:\n$h(t) = 4||s - 1/2| - 1/4|$.\n\nLet's analyze $h(t)$ for $s \\in [0, 1]$:\n- If $s \\in [0, 1/4]$, $h(t) = 4|(1/2 - s) - 1/4| = 4|1/4 - s| = 4(1/4 - s) = 1 - 4s$.\n- If $s \\in [1/4, 1/2]$, $h(t) = 4|(1/2 - s) - 1/4| = 4|1/4 - s| = 4(s - 1/4) = 4s - 1$.\n- If $s \\in [1/2, 3/4]$, $h(t) = 4|(s - 1/2) - 1/4| = 4|s - 3/4| = 4(3/4 - s) = 3 - 4s$.\n- If $s \\in [3/4, 1]$, $h(t) = 4|(s - 3/4) - 1/4| = 4|s - 3/4| = 4(s - 3/4) = 4s - 3$.\n\nLet's check the values of $h(t)$ at $s = 0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1$:\n- $s=0: h(t) = 1$.\n- $s=1/4: h(t) = 0$.\n- $s=1/2: h(t) = 1$.\n- $s=3/4: h(t) = 0$.\n- $s=1: h(t) = 1$.\n\nThe graph of $h(s)$ for $s \\in [0,1]$ starts at 1, goes down to 0, up to 1, down to 0, and up to 1 again. It consists of 4 linear segments. The range of $h(t)$ for $t \\in [-1,1]$ is $[0,1]$.\nFrom the equations, we can see that $x, y$ must be in $[0,1]$. We are looking for the number of intersection points in the unit square $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$.\n\nLet $C_1$ be the graph of $y = h(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ and $C_2$ be the graph of $x = h(\\cos(3\\pi y))$.\n\nLet's analyze $C_1: y = h(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)$ for $x \\in [0,1]$.\nLet $s(x) = |\\sin(2\\pi x)|$. As $x$ goes from 0 to 1, the function $s(x)$ completes two arches.\n- For $x \\in [0, 1/2]$, $s(x)$ goes from 0 to 1 and back to 0.\n- For $x \\in [1/2, 1]$, $s(x)$ goes from 0 to 1 and back to 0.\n\nAs $s$ goes from 0 to 1, $h(s)$ goes from 1 to 0, to 1, to 0, to 1. This corresponds to 4 monotonic, linear segments.\nAs $s$ goes from 1 to 0, $h(s)$ traces the same path in reverse, corresponding to another 4 monotonic, linear segments.\nSo, for each arch of $s(x)$ (where $s$ goes $0 \\to 1 \\to 0$), the graph of $y(x)$ consists of $4+4=8$ monotonic segments.\nSince $s(x)=|\\sin(2\\pi x)|$ has two arches for $x \\in [0,1]$, the graph of $C_1$ consists of $2 \\times 8 = 16$ monotonic segments.\nEach of these segments corresponds to $y$ going from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. Let's call these \"vertical segments\".\n\nLet's analyze $C_2: x = h(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|)$ for $y \\in [0,1]$.\nLet $s'(y) = |\\cos(3\\pi y)|$. As $y$ goes from 0 to 1, $3\\pi y$ goes from 0 to $3\\pi$. The function $|\\cos(t)|$ has a period of $\\pi$. So $s'(y)$ completes 3 cycles as $y$ goes from 0 to 1.\nThe zeros of $\\cos(3\\pi y)$ are at $3\\pi y = \\pi/2, 3\\pi/2, 5\\pi/2$, which means $y=1/6, 1/2, 5/6$.\nThe function $s'(y)$ makes 3 arches, for $y \\in [0,1/3]$, $y \\in [1/3,2/3]$, $y \\in [2/3,1]$ is not quite right.\nThe arches of $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|$ are over $y \\in [0,1/6]\\cup[1/6,1/2]\\cup[1/2,5/6]\\cup[5/6,1]$.\nLet's count the number of times $s'(y)$ goes from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 for $y \\in [0,1]$:\n- $y \\in [0, 1/6]$: $s'$ goes from 1 to 0.\n- $y \\in [1/6, 1/3]$: $s'$ goes from 0 to 1.\n- $y \\in [1/3, 1/2]$: $s'$ goes from 1 to 0.\n- $y \\in [1/2, 2/3]$: $s'$ goes from 0 to 1.\n- $y \\in [2/3, 5/6]$: $s'$ goes from 1 to 0.\n- $y \\in [5/6, 1]$: $s'$ goes from 0 to 1.\nThere are 6 such intervals where $s'(y)$ is monotonic.\nIn each such interval, the graph of $x(y) = h(s'(y))$ consists of 4 monotonic segments, as $h(s)$ has 4 monotonic parts for $s \\in [0,1]$.\nSo, the graph of $C_2$ consists of $6 \\times 4 = 24$ monotonic segments.\nEach of these segments corresponds to $x$ going from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. Let's call these \"horizontal segments\".\n\nWe want to find the number of intersections of $C_1$ and $C_2$ in the square $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$.\n$C_1$ is a union of 16 vertical segments, $\\cup_{i=1}^{16} V_i$.\n$C_2$ is a union of 24 horizontal segments, $\\cup_{j=1}^{24} H_j$.\nThe number of intersections is the sum of intersections of all pairs of segments $|V_i \\cap H_j|$.\n\nLet's consider one vertical segment $V_i$ and one horizontal segment $H_j$.\n$V_i$ is the graph of a function $y=f(x)$ for $x$ in some interval $[x_1, x_2]$. The function $f$ is monotonic and its range is $[0,1]$.\n$H_j$ is the graph of a function $x=g(y)$ for $y$ in some interval $[y_1, y_2]$. The function $g$ is monotonic and its range is $[0,1]$.\n\nAn intersection is a point $(x,y)$ satisfying $y=f(x)$ and $x=g(y)$. This is equivalent to finding a fixed point of the composition $x=g(f(x))$.\nLet $F(x) = g(f(x))$. $F$ is a continuous monotonic function that maps $[x_1, x_2]$ to $[0,1]$.\nThe function $f$ is a bijection from $[x_1, x_2]$ to $[0,1]$.\nThe function $g$ is a bijection from $[y_1, y_2]$ to $[0,1]$.\nLet's analyze the value of $F(x)-x$.\nThe endpoints of $f$ are $(x_1, y_{start})$ and $(x_2, y_{end})$ where $\\{y_{start}, y_{end}\\} = \\{0,1\\}$.\nThe endpoints of $g$ are $(x'_{start}, y_1)$ and $(x'_{end}, y_2)$ where $\\{x'_{start}, x'_{end}\\} = \\{0,1\\}$.\nLet's assume $f$ is increasing, so $f(x_1)=0, f(x_2)=1$.\nLet's assume $g$ is increasing, so $g(y_1)=0, g(y_2)=1$. The domain of $g$ is $[y_1, y_2]$, but its values are needed at $y=0$ and $y=1$. The segments are defined on subintervals of $y$, but they are part of a larger curve $x(y)$ defined on $[0,1]$. The function $g$ is a restriction of $x(y)$ to $[y_1, y_2]$.\nThe values $g(0)$ and $g(1)$ are either 0 or 1.\nLet's consider the composite function $F(x)=g(f(x))$ for $x \\in [x_1, x_2]$.\n$F(x_1) = g(f(x_1)) = g(0)$. $F(x_2) = g(f(x_2)) = g(1)$.\nThe values $g(0)$ and $g(1)$ depend on which horizontal segment we are considering. But $g(0)$ and $g(1)$ must be in $\\{0,1\\}$.\nLet's consider the function $\\phi(x) = g(f(x)) - x$.\n$\\phi(x_1) = g(0) - x_1$. Since $x_1 \\in [0,1]$ and $g(0) \\in \\{0,1\\}$, $\\phi(x_1)$ can be positive, negative or zero.\nFor example, if $g(0)=0$ and $x_1>0$, $\\phi(x_1)<0$. If $g(0)=1$ and $x_1<1$, $\\phi(x_1)>0$.\nLet's consider the four possibilities for monotonicity of $f$ and $g$.\n1. $f$ increasing ($f(x_1)=0, f(x_2)=1$), $g$ increasing ($g(0)=0, g(1)=1$).\n$\\phi(x_1) = 0-x_1 \\le 0$. $\\phi(x_2) = 1-x_2 \\ge 0$. A solution must exist.\n2. $f$ increasing ($f(x_1)=0, f(x_2)=1$), $g$ decreasing ($g(0)=1, g(1)=0$).\n$\\phi(x_1) = 1-x_1 \\ge 0$. $\\phi(x_2) = 0-x_2 \\le 0$. A solution must exist.\n3. $f$ decreasing ($f(x_1)=1, f(x_2)=0$), $g$ increasing ($g(0)=0, g(1)=1$).\n$\\phi(x_1) = 1-x_1 \\ge 0$. $\\phi(x_2) = 0-x_2 \\le 0$. A solution must exist.\n4. $f$ decreasing ($f(x_1)=1, f(x_2)=0$), $g$ decreasing ($g(0)=1, g(1)=0$).\n$\\phi(x_1) = 0-x_1 \\le 0$. $\\phi(x_2) = 1-x_2 \\ge 0$. A solution must exist.\n\nIn all cases, since $\\phi(x)$ is continuous and monotonic, there is exactly one solution for $x \\in [x_1, x_2]$. This means that each vertical segment of $C_1$ intersects each horizontal segment of $C_2$ exactly once.\nThe number of vertical segments for $C_1$ is 16.\nThe number of horizontal segments for $C_2$ is 24.\nThe total number of intersections is the product of the number of segments of each curve.\nTotal intersections = $16 \\times 24$.\n$16 \\times 24 = 16 \\times (20 + 4) = 320 + 64 = 384$.\n\nThis counts all intersections, including those on the boundaries of the segments. The argument for existence and uniqueness of the intersection holds also when the intersection is at an endpoint.\n\nFinal check of segment numbers:\n- $y=h(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)$: $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|$ has 4 monotonic sections on $[0,1]$. $h(s)$ has 4 monotonic sections on $[0,1]$. Total: $4 \\times 4 = 16$.\n- $x=h(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|)$: $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|$ has 6 monotonic sections on $[0,1]$ (extrema at $y=k/3$, zeros at $y=(2k+1)/6$). Total: $6 \\times 4 = 24$.\n\nThe logic holds. The number of intersections is $16 \\times 24 = 384$.\n\n"

"Let the two given equations be\n(1) $y = 4 g(f(\\sin (2 \\pi x)))$\n(2) $x = 4 g(f(\\cos (3 \\pi y)))$\n\nFirst, let's analyze the function composition. Let $h(t) = 4g(f(t))$.\nThe functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are defined as $f(x)=|| x|-\\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\\tfrac{1}{4}|$.\nThe composition is $g(f(t)) = ||f(t)|-\\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Since $f(t) = ||t|-\\tfrac{1}{2}| \\ge 0$, this simplifies to $g(f(t)) = |f(t)-\\tfrac{1}{4}|$.\nSo, $h(t) = 4|f(t)-\\tfrac{1}{4}| = 4|||t|-\\tfrac{1}{2}| - \\tfrac{1}{4}|$.\n\nThe arguments of $h$ are $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ and $\\cos(3\\pi y)$, which are both in the interval $[-1, 1]$. We are interested in the behavior of $h(t)$ for $t \\in [-1, 1]$.\nLet's analyze $h(t)$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$. In this case, $|t|=t$.\n$h(t) = 4||t-\\tfrac{1}{2}| - \\tfrac{1}{4}|$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$.\n- If $t \\in [0, 1/2]$, $h(t) = 4|(\\tfrac{1}{2}-t) - \\tfrac{1}{4}| = 4|\\tfrac{1}{4}-t|$.\n  - For $t \\in [0, 1/4]$, $h(t) = 4(\\tfrac{1}{4}-t) = 1-4t$. This is a line segment from $(0,1)$ to $(1/4,0)$.\n  - For $t \\in [1/4, 1/2]$, $h(t) = 4(t-\\tfrac{1}{4}) = 4t-1$. This is a line segment from $(1/4,0)$ to $(1/2,1)$.\n- If $t \\in [1/2, 1]$, $h(t) = 4|(t-\\tfrac{1}{2}) - \\tfrac{1}{4}| = 4|t-\\tfrac{3}{4}|$.\n  - For $t \\in [1/2, 3/4]$, $h(t) = 4(\\tfrac{3}{4}-t) = 3-4t$. This is a line segment from $(1/2,1)$ to $(3/4,0)$.\n  - For $t \\in [3/4, 1]$, $h(t) = 4(t-\\tfrac{3}{4}) = 4t-3$. This is a line segment from $(3/4,0)$ to $(1,1)$.\nThe graph of $h(t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ looks like a \"W\" shape, consisting of 4 linear segments.\nThe function $h(t)$ is even, since $h(t) = 4|||t|-\\tfrac{1}{2}| - \\tfrac{1}{4}| = 4|||-t|-\\tfrac{1}{2}| - \\tfrac{1}{4}| = h(-t)$.\nSo, the graph of $h(t)$ for $t \\in [-1,0]$ is a reflection of the graph for $t \\in [0,1]$. The full graph of $h(t)$ on $[-1,1]$ looks like two W's side-by-side, one being the reflection of the other. This graph is composed of $4+4=8$ monotonic linear segments.\n\nThe equations become:\n(1) $y = h(\\sin(2\\pi x))$\n(2) $x = h(\\cos(3\\pi y))$\nSince the range of $h(t)$ for $t \\in [-1,1]$ is $[0,1]$, any solution $(x,y)$ must be in the square $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$.\n\nLet's analyze the graph of equation (1), $C_1$, for $x \\in [0,1]$.\nLet $u(x) = \\sin(2\\pi x)$. As $x$ goes from $0$ to $1$, $u$ goes from $0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to -1 \\to 0$.\n- For $x \\in [0, 1/2]$, $u(x)$ goes from $0 \\to 1 \\to 0$. This covers the domain $[0,1]$ for $h$ and then back. The graph of $h(u)$ on $[0,1]$ has 4 monotonic segments. So, as $u$ goes from $0$ to $1$, $y(x)$ traces a W-shape (4 segments). As $u$ goes from $1$ to $0$, $y(x)$ traces the W-shape in reverse (another 4 segments). This gives $4+4=8$ monotonic segments for $y(x)$ on $[0, 1/2]$.\n- For $x \\in [1/2, 1]$, $u(x)$ goes from $0 \\to -1 \\to 0$. Since $h$ is even, the graph of $h(u)$ on $[-1,0]$ is the same shape as on $[0,1]$. This gives another 8 monotonic segments for $y(x)$ on $[1/2, 1]$.\nIn total, the graph of $y(x)$ on $[0,1]$ consists of $8+8=16$ monotonic segments.\n\nLet's analyze the graph of equation (2), $C_2$, for $y \\in [0,1]$.\nLet $v(y) = \\cos(3\\pi y)$. As $y$ goes from $0$ to $1$, $v$ goes from $1 \\to -1 \\to 1$.\n- For $y \\in [0, 1/3]$, $v(y)$ goes from $1 \\to -1$. This covers the domain $[-1,1]$ for $h$ once. The graph of $h(v)$ on $[-1,1]$ has 8 monotonic segments. Since $v(y)$ is monotonic on this interval, the graph of $x(y)$ on $[0,1/3]$ consists of 8 monotonic segments.\n- For $y \\in [1/3, 2/3]$, $v(y)$ goes from $-1 \\to 1$. This gives another 8 monotonic segments.\n- For $y \\in [2/3, 1]$, $v(y)$ goes from $1 \\to -1$. This gives another 8 monotonic segments.\nIn total, the graph of $x(y)$ on $[0,1]$ consists of $8+8+8=24$ monotonic segments.\n\nWe are looking for the number of intersection points of the graphs $C_1$ and $C_2$ in the square $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$.\nLet's define a grid on the square $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$. The vertical grid lines are defined by the $x$-values where $y(x)$ changes its monotonicity. The horizontal grid lines are defined by the $y$-values where $x(y)$ changes its monotonicity.\nThe function $y(x)$ is monotonic between consecutive points in the set $\\{x | \\sin(2\\pi x) \\in \\{0, \\pm 1/4, \\pm 1/2, \\pm 3/4, \\pm 1\\}\\}$. These define the endpoints of the 16 intervals of monotonicity for $y(x)$.\nThe function $x(y)$ is monotonic between consecutive points in the set $\\{y | \\cos(3\\pi y) \\in \\{0, \\pm 1/4, \\pm 1/2, \\pm 3/4, \\pm 1\\}\\}$. These define the endpoints of the 24 intervals of monotonicity for $x(y)$.\n\nThis creates a grid of $16 \\times 24$ small rectangles. Let's consider one such rectangle, $R = [x_1, x_2] \\times [y_1, y_2]$.\nInside this rectangle, both $y(x)$ and $x(y)$ are strictly monotonic.\nThe graph of $C_1$ within $R$ is a curve connecting the vertical sides of $R$, i.e., from a point on $\\{x_1\\} \\times [y_1, y_2]$ to a point on $\\{x_2\\} \\times [y_1, y_2]$. This is because the range of $y(x)$ on $[x_1, x_2]$ is $[0,1]$ or $[1,0]$, which contains $[y_1, y_2]$.\nSimilarly, the graph of $C_2$ within $R$ is a curve connecting the horizontal sides of $R$.\nA continuous curve connecting the vertical sides of a rectangle must intersect a continuous curve connecting the horizontal sides of the same rectangle. Since both curves are monotonic within the rectangle, they must intersect exactly once.\n\nThis heuristic suggests that there is one intersection point in each of these $16 \\times 24$ rectangles.\nThe total number of intersections would then be $16 \\times 24$.\n$16 \\times 24 = 16 \\times (25 - 1) = 400 - 16 = 384$.\n\nThis argument relies on the intersections being in the interior of these rectangles. A potential issue arises if an intersection point lies on the boundary of these rectangles.\nAn intersection $(x_0, y_0)$ is on a boundary if $y_0$ is a local extremum for $x(y)$ or $x_0$ is a local extremum for $y(x)$.\nThe local extrema for $y(x)$ are at $y=0$ and $y=1$.\nThe local extrema for $x(y)$ are at $x=0$ and $x=1$.\nSo, any intersection on a boundary must have $x,y \\in \\{0,1\\}$. We check the four corner points of the square:\n- $(0,0)$: $y(0)=h(0)=1 \\ne 0$. Not a solution.\n- $(0,1)$: $y(0)=1$. $x(1)=h(\\cos(3\\pi))=h(-1)=1 \\ne 0$. Not a solution.\n- $(1,0)$: $y(1)=h(\\sin(2\\pi))=h(0)=1 \\ne 0$. Not a solution.\n- $(1,1)$: $y(1)=h(0)=1$. $x(1)=h(-1)=1$. This is a solution.\n\nThe point $(1,1)$ is a vertex of one of the $16 \\times 24$ rectangles. The argument based on counting one intersection per cell is not strictly valid for the cell(s) sharing this vertex.\nHowever, we can use a perturbation argument. Consider the slightly perturbed system:\n$y = h(\\sin(2\\pi x))$\n$x = h(\\cos(3\\pi y)) - \\epsilon$ for a small $\\epsilon > 0$.\nThe graphs are slightly shifted, and the solution $(1,1)$ is no longer a solution. The new solution near $(1,1)$ is now in the interior of a rectangle. All other intersections are also slightly shifted but remain in their respective rectangles. The intersections are transversal, so no solutions are created or annihilated by this small perturbation. The number of solutions for the perturbed system is $16 \\times 24 = 384$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the solutions move continuously to the solutions of the original system. Thus, the number of solutions is conserved.\n\nThe number of monotonic sections for $y(x)$ is 16.\nThe number of monotonic sections for $x(y)$ is 24.\nThe number of intersections is the product of these two numbers.\nNumber of intersections = $16 \\times 24 = 384$.\n\n"

So we are interested in $h(t)$ for $t \\in [-1, 1]$.\nFor $t \\in [-1, 1]$, we have $|t| \\in [0, 1]$. Let $u = |t|$.\n$h(t) = 4||u - 1/2| - 1/4|$ for $u \\in [0, 1]$.\nLet's analyze the shape of $h(t)$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$ (so $u=t$).\n- If $t \\in [0, 1/2]$, $h(t) = 4|(1/2 - t) - 1/4| = 4|1/4 - t|$. This gives a V-shape with vertex at $(1/4, 0)$. $h(0)=1$, $h(1/4)=0$, $h(1/2)=1$.\n- If $t \\in [1/2, 1]$, $h(t) = 4|(t - 1/2) - 1/4| = 4|t - 3/4|$. This gives a V-shape with vertex at $(3/4, 0)$. $h(1/2)=1$, $h(3/4)=0$, $h(1)=1$.\nSo for $t \\in [0, 1]$, the graph of $h(t)$ is a \"W\" shape connecting the points $(0,1), (1/4,0), (1/2,1), (3/4,0), (1,1)$.\nSince $h(t)$ depends only on $|t|$, $h(t)$ is an even function. The graph for $t \\in [-1, 0]$ is a mirror image of the graph for $t \\in [0, 1]$.\nThe range of $h(t)$ for $t \\in [-1, 1]$ is $[0, 1]$.\nFrom (1), $y \\in [0, 1]$ and from (2), $x \\in [0, 1]$. So we are looking for intersections in the unit square $[0, 1] \\times [0, 1]$.\n\nThe system of equations is:\n(1) $y = h(\\sin(2\\pi x))$\n(2) $x = h(\\cos(3\\pi y))$\n\nWe can substitute (1) into (2) to get a fixed-point equation for $x$:\n$x = h(\\cos(3\\pi h(\\sin(2\\pi x))))$.\nLet $k(x) = h(\\cos(3\\pi h(\\sin(2\\pi x))))$. We need to find the number of solutions to $x = k(x)$ for $x \\in [0, 1]$.\n\nLet's analyze the function $k(x)$.\nLet $y(x) = h(\\sin(2\\pi x))$. As $x$ goes from $0$ to $1$, $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ goes from $0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to -1 \\to 0$.\nSince $h(t)$ is even, the behavior for $t \\in [0, -1]$ is the same as for $t \\in [0, 1]$.\nThe path $0 \\to 1 \\to 0$ for $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ corresponds to $x \\in [0, 1/2]$. This makes $y(x)$ trace two \"W\" shapes.\nThe path $0 \\to -1 \\to 0$ for $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ corresponds to $x \\in [1/2, 1]$. This makes $y(x)$ trace another two \"W\" shapes.\nIn total, the graph of $y(x)$ for $x \\in [0,1]$ consists of 4 \"W\" shapes.\nThe local extrema of $y(x)$ occur when $h(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ is 0 or 1. This happens when $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|$ takes values from the set $\\{0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1\\}$.\nLet $p_0, p_1, \\dots, p_{16}$ be the ordered values of $x \\in [0,1]$ for which $|\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\in \\{0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1\\}$.\nWe have $0=p_0 < p_1 < \\dots < p_{16}=1$. These 17 points define 16 intervals.\nAt each $p_i}$, $y(p_i) = h(\\sin(2\\pi p_i))$ is either 0 or 1.\n- If $y(p_i)=0$, then $|\\sin(2\\pi p_i)| \\in \\{1/4, 3/4\\}$.\n- If $y(p_i)=1$, then $|\\sin(2\\pi p_i)| \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$.\n\nNow, let's evaluate $k(p_i)$.\n$k(p_i) = h(\\cos(3\\pi y(p_i)))$.\n- If $y(p_i)=0$, $k(p_i) = h(\\cos(0)) = h(1) = 1$.\n- If $y(p_i)=1$, $k(p_i) = h(\\cos(3\\pi)) = h(-1) = 1$.\nSo, for all $i=0, \\dots, 16$, we have $k(p_i)=1$.\n\nNow consider an interval $(p_i, p_{i+1})$. In such an interval, $y(x)$ is monotonic, varying between 0 and 1.\n- If $y(x)$ goes from 0 to 1, then $3\\pi y(x)$ goes from $0$ to $3\\pi$. The argument of $h$, $\\cos(3\\pi y(x))$, goes from $\\cos(0)=1$ to $\\cos(3\\pi)=-1$.\n- If $y(x)$ goes from 1 to 0, then $3\\pi y(x)$ goes from $3\\pi$ to $0$. The argument $\\cos(3\\pi y(x))$ goes from $-1$ to $1$.\nIn both cases, the argument of $h$ in $k(x)$ sweeps the interval $[-1, 1]$.\nThe graph of $h(t)$ for $t \\in [-1, 1]$ consists of two \"W\" shapes (one for $t \\in [-1,0]$ and one for $t \\in [0,1]$).\nSo, in each interval $(p_i, p_{i+1})$, the function $k(x)$ starts at $k(p_i)=1$, traces two \"W\" shapes, and ends at $k(p_{i+1})=1$.\nA \"W\" shape for $h(t)$ on $[0,1]$ goes $1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1$. A double \"W\" on $[-1,1]$ goes $1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1$.\nSo, in each of the 16 intervals $(p_i, p_{i+1})$, $k(x)$ starts at 1, has 4 local minima equal to 0, and ends at 1.\n\nWe are looking for the number of solutions to $k(x)=x$.\nLet's analyze the number of solutions in one such interval $(p_i, p_{i+1})$.\nLet the four minima in this interval occur at $m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4$. Let the three intermediate maxima occur at $M_1, M_2, M_3$.\n$k(p_i)=1, k(M_j)=1, k(p_{i+1})=1$.\n$k(m_j)=0$.\nLet's study the sign of $d(x) = k(x)-x$.\nFor $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 15\\}$, $p_i < 1$. So $d(p_i) = k(p_i) - p_i = 1 - p_i > 0$.\nFor any minimum $m_j \\in (p_i, p_{i+1})$, $m_j>0$. So $d(m_j) = k(m_j) - m_j = 0 - m_j < 0$.\nFor any intermediate maximum $M_j \\in (p_i, p_{i+1})$, $M_j<1$. So $d(M_j) = k(M_j) - M_j = 1 - M_j > 0$.\n\nConsider the interval $(p_i, p_{i+1})$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 14\\}$.\n$d(p_i) > 0$ and $d(p_{i+1}) > 0$.\nThe sign of $d(x)$ at the extrema of $k(x)$ follows the pattern:\n$d(p_i)>0 \\to d(m_1)<0 \\to d(M_1)>0 \\to d(m_2)<0 \\to d(M_2)>0 \\to d(m_3)<0 \\to d(M_3)>0 \\to d(m_4)<0 \\to d(p_{i+1})>0$.\nBy the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is at least one root between any two points where $d(x)$ has opposite signs.\n- On $(p_i, m_1)$, there is a root.\n- On $(m_1, M_1)$, there is a root.\n- On $(M_1, m_2)$, there is a root.\n- On $(m_2, M_2)$, there is a root.\n- On $(M_2, m_3)$, there is a root.\n- On $(m_3, M_3)$, there is a root.\n- On $(M_3, m_4)$, there is a root.\n- On $(m_4, p_{i+1})$, there is a root.\nThis gives 8 roots in each of the first 15 intervals $(p_0, p_1), \\dots, (p_{14}, p_{15})$.\nSince $k(x)$ is monotonic between these extrema, each root is unique within that segment.\nSo we have $15 \\times 8 = 120$ roots.\n\nNow consider the last interval, $(p_{15}, p_{16}) = (p_{15}, 1)$.\n$d(p_{15}) = k(p_{15}) - p_{15} = 1 - p_{15} > 0$.\n$d(p_{16}) = d(1) = k(1) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0$. So $x=1$ is a solution.\nThe sign sequence is:\n$d(p_{15})>0 \\to d(m_1)<0 \\to \\dots \\to d(M_3)>0 \\to d(m_4)<0$.\nThis gives 7 roots in $(p_{15}, m_4)$.\nNow we need to check the last segment $(m_4, 1)$.\n$d(m_4) = -m_4 < 0$. $d(1)=0$.\nSince $d(x)$ changes from a negative value to zero, there must be at least one root in $(m_4, 1]$. We know $x=1$ is a root.\nTo see if there are other roots, we can check the derivative $d'(1) = k'(1)-1$.\nOne can show that $k'(1)=0$. So $d'(1)=-1$.\nThis means that for $x$ just less than 1, $d(x) > d(1)=0$.\nBut $d(m_4)<0$. So $d(x)$ must go from negative to positive, and then back down to 0 at $x=1$. This implies there must be at least two roots in $(m_4, 1)$.\nHowever, a more careful analysis of the function $k(x)$ shows that on each monotonic segment of $k(x)$, it intersects the line $y=x$ at most once.\nLet's re-examine the argument based on sign changes.\n$d(p_{15})>0$. $d(m_1)<0$. Root 1.\n$d(m_1)<0$. $d(M_1)>0$. Root 2.\n...\n$d(M_3)>0$. $d(m_4)<0$. Root 7.\n$d(m_4)<0$. $d(1)=0$. Root 8 is $x=1$.\nThe function $d(x)$ on $(m_4, 1)$ starts negative and ends at 0. It is not guaranteed there is another root. For instance, $d(x)=-(1-x)^2$ on $[0,1]$.\nLet's assume the simplest behavior, where there is no extra wiggle. This gives one root on $[m_4,1]$, which is $x=1$.\nThis gives $7+1=8$ roots in the last interval as well.\n\nTotal number of solutions = $16 \\times 8 = 128$.\nThe points $p_i$ for $i=0, \\dots, 15$ are not solutions, as $k(p_i)=1$ but $p_i \\ne 1$. $p_{16}=1$ is a solution.\nThe solutions are located inside the intervals $(p_i, p_{i+1})$, with the exception of $x=1$.\nThe argument for 8 roots in each of the 16 intervals is consistent.\n\nFinal count: 16 intervals, each contributing 8 intersection points.\nTotal intersections = $16 \\times 8 = 128$.\n\n"

"Let the two given equations be\n(1) $y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))$\n(2) $x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))$\n\nThe functions are $f(t) = ||t|-\\frac{1}{2}|$ and $g(t) = ||t|-\\frac{1}{4}|$.\nLet's define a composite function $H(t) = 4g(f(t))$.\n$f(t)$ takes values in $[0, \\infty)$, so for $u=f(t)$, we have $|u|=u$.\n$g(f(t)) = g(u) = |u-\\frac{1}{4}| = |||t|-\\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4}|$.\nSo, $H(t) = 4|||t|-\\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4}|$.\n\nThe equations become:\n(1) $y = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$\n(2) $x = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$\n\nLet's analyze the function $H(t)$ for $t \\in [-1, 1]$, which is the range of sine and cosine.\nFor $t \\in [-1, 1]$, $|t| \\in [0, 1]$. Let $v=|t|$.\n$H(t) = 4||v-\\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4}|$.\nThe range of $v-\\frac{1}{2}$ is $[-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}]$, so $|v-\\frac{1}{2}| \\in [0, \\frac{1}{2}]$.\nThe range of $|v-\\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4}$ is $[-\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{4}]$.\nThe range of $H(t)$ is $4 \\times [0, \\frac{1}{4}] = [0, 1]$.\nSo from the equations, we must have $x \\in [0, 1]$ and $y \\in [0, 1]$.\n\nLet's analyze the behavior of $H(t)$ for $t \\in [-1, 1]$.\n$H(t)=0$ when $|||t|-\\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4}| = 0 \\implies ||t|-\\frac{1}{2}| = \\frac{1}{4} \\implies |t|-\\frac{1}{2} = \\pm\\frac{1}{4}$.\nThis gives $|t| = \\frac{3}{4}$ or $|t| = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n$H(t)=1$ when $|||t|-\\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4}| = \\frac{1}{4} \\implies ||t|-\\frac{1}{2}| = \\frac{1}{2}$ or $0$.\nThis gives $|t|-\\frac{1}{2} = \\pm\\frac{1}{2}$ or $|t|-\\frac{1}{2}=0$.\nSo $|t|=1, 0$ or $|t|=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nLet's denote $y(x) = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ and $x(y) = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$. We want to find the number of solutions to the system $y=y(x)$ and $x=x(y)$ for $(x,y) \\in [0,1]^2$.\nThis is equivalent to finding the number of solutions to $x = x(y(x))$ for $x \\in [0,1]$.\n\nLet's analyze the functions $y(x)$ and $x(y)$.\nThe function $y(x)$ has minima (value 0) when $|\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\in \\{1/4, 3/4\\}$.\nFor $c \\in (0,1)$, $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|=c$ has 4 solutions for $x \\in (0,1)$.\nSo $y(x)=0$ for $4+4=8$ distinct values of $x \\in (0,1)$. Let's call these $z^y_1, \\dots, z^y_8$ in increasing order.\nThe function $y(x)$ has maxima (value 1) when $|\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$.\n$|\\sin(2\\pi x)|=0 \\implies x=0, 1/2, 1$.\n$|\\sin(2\\pi x)|=1/2 \\implies 4$ solutions in $(0,1)$.\n$|\\sin(2\\pi x)|=1 \\implies x=1/4, 3/4$.\nSo $y(x)=1$ for $3+4+2=9$ values of $x \\in [0,1]$.\nThe graph of $y(x)$ for $x \\in [0,1]$ starts at $y(0)=H(0)=1$, ends at $y(1)=H(0)=1$. It oscillates, touching $y=0$ at 8 points. This structure consists of 8 \"arches\" connecting points where $y=0$. Let's call the part of the graph between two consecutive zeros an arch. There are 7 full arches and two half-arches at the ends.\n\nThe function $x(y)$ has minima (value 0) when $|\\cos(3\\pi y)| \\in \\{1/4, 3/4\\}$.\nFor $c \\in (0,1)$, $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|=c$ has 6 solutions for $y \\in (0,1)$.\nSo $x(y)=0$ for $6+6=12$ distinct values of $y \\in (0,1)$.\nThe function $x(y)$ has maxima (value 1) when $|\\cos(3\\pi y)| \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$.\n$|\\cos(3\\pi y)|=0 \\implies 3$ solutions in $(0,1)$.\n$|\\cos(3\\pi y)|=1/2 \\implies 6$ solutions in $(0,1)$.\n$|\\cos(3\\pi y)|=1 \\implies y=0, 1/3, 2/3, 1$.\nSo $x(y)=1$ for $3+6+4=13$ values of $y \\in [0,1]$.\nThe graph of $x(y)$ for $y \\in [0,1]$ consists of 12 arches.\n\nLet's analyze the equation $x=x(y(x))$. Let $h(x) = x(y(x))$.\nWe need to count the number of solutions to $h(x)=x$.\nLet's analyze $h(x)$ on an interval $[z^y_i, z^y_{i+1}]$ between two consecutive zeros of $y(x)$.\nOn this interval, $y(x)$ starts at 0, increases to a maximum of 1 at the midpoint $m_i$, and decreases back to 0.\nAs $x$ goes from $z^y_i$ to $m_i$, $y(x)$ goes from 0 to 1.\nThe function $h(x)=x(y(x))$ will trace the graph of $x(y)$ for $y \\in [0,1]$.\nThe function $x(y)$ for $y \\in [0,1]$ starts at $x(0)=1$, ends at $x(1)=1$, and has 12 zeros in between. So it consists of 12 arches.\nSo, on the interval $[z^y_i, m_i]$, the function $h(x)$ starts at $h(z^y_i)=x(0)=1$, ends at $h(m_i)=x(1)=1$, and has 12 minima of 0 in between.\nLet's count the solutions of $h(x)=x$ on $[z^y_i, m_i]$.\nAt the left endpoint, $h(z^y_i)=1$ and $x=z^y_i$. Since $z^y_i \\in (0,1)$, $h(z^y_i) > z^y_i$.\nLet the minima of $h(x)$ on this interval occur at $x_1, \\dots, x_{12}$. At these points $h(x_k)=0$, so $h(x_k) < x_k$.\nBy the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be at least one solution between $z^y_i$ and $x_1$.\nBetween any two consecutive minima $x_k$ and $x_{k+1}$, $h(x)$ goes from 0 up to a maximum of 1 and back to 0. The line $g(x)=x$ is below the maximum. So $h(x)-x$ goes from negative to positive and back to negative. This means there are two solutions between $x_k$ and $x_{k+1}$.\nThere are 11 such intervals between the 12 minima. This gives $11 \\times 2 = 22$ solutions.\nFinally, between the last minimum $x_{12}$ and the endpoint $m_i$, $h(x)$ goes from 0 to 1. $h(x_{12}) < x_{12}$ and $h(m_i) > m_i$. So there is at least one solution.\nIn fact, the function $h(x)$ is composed of pieces of $H$. The shape of each arch is similar. We can argue for exactly one solution when going from 0 to 1 and two when going $0 \\to 1 \\to 0$.\nSo on $[z^y_i, m_i]$, we have $1+2\\times 11+1=24$ solutions.\nAs $x$ goes from $m_i$ to $z^y_{i+1}$, $y(x)$ goes from 1 to 0. $h(x)$ traces the same graph of $x(y)$ but backwards. This again gives 24 solutions.\nSo for each of the 7 full-arch intervals $[z^y_i, z^y_{i+1}]$, we have $24+24=48$ solutions.\nTotal for these 7 intervals: $7 \\times 48 = 336$.\n\nNow we must consider the intervals at the ends: $[0, z^y_1]$ and $[z^y_8, 1]$.\nOn $[0, z^y_1]$, $y(x)$ goes from $y(0)=1$ down to $y(z^y_1)=0$.\nSo $h(x)=x(y(x))$ goes from $h(0)=x(1)=1$ to $h(z^y_1)=x(0)=1$.\nThis is the same behavior as on $[z^y_i, m_i]$ (or $[m_i, z^y_{i+1}]$), just over a different $x$ interval.\n$h(0)=1 > g(0)=0$. $h(z^y_1)=1 > g(z^y_1)=z^y_1$.\nThe function $h(x)$ on $[0, z^y_1]$ has 12 minima of 0.\nUsing the same logic as before, we find 24 solutions on $[0, z^y_1]$.\nOn $[z^y_8, 1]$, $y(x)$ goes from $y(z^y_8)=0$ up to $y(1)=1$.\nSo $h(x)=x(y(x))$ goes from $h(z^y_8)=x(0)=1$ to $h(1)=x(1)=1$.\nThis interval behaves like $[z^y_i, m_i]$.\n$h(z^y_8)=1 > z^y_8$. $h(1)=1=g(1)$. So $x=1$ is a solution.\nLet's re-examine the last interval $[z^y_8, 1]$.\n$h(x)$ has 12 minima. $h(z^y_8)=1 > z^y_8$. $h(1)=1$.\nBetween $z^y_8$ and the first minimum, there is one solution.\nBetween the 11 pairs of minima, there are $11 \\times 2 = 22$ solutions.\nBetween the last minimum and $x=1$, $h(x)$ goes from 0 to 1. The line $g(x)=x$ goes from some value to 1. They meet at $x=1$. Is it possible they meet before? Let's assume the arches are shaped nicely, so they meet only once. This gives 1 solution.\nSo on $[z^y_8, 1]$, we have $1+22+1=24$ solutions.\nThe total number of solutions is $336 + 24 + 24 = 384$.\n\nLet's verify the argument.\nNumber of full arches of $y(x)$ is 7. Number of half-arches is 2.\nNumber of full arches of $x(y)$ is 12.\nNumber of intersections in a region corresponding to a full $y$-arch and a full $x$-arch is 2.\nThis is not how the argument worked.\nLet $N_y=8$ be the number of arches of $y(x)$ (treating half-arches as wholes for a moment).\nLet $N_x=12$ be the number of arches of $x(y)$.\nMy detailed argument gives $2 \\times N_y \\times N_x = 2 \\times 8 \\times 12 = 192$. Let me re-derive.\nLet's analyze $h(x)=x$ on $[z^y_i, m_i]$. $y(x)$ goes $0 \\to 1$. $h(x)$ traces $x(y)$ on $y \\in [0,1]$.\n$x(y)$ has 12 arches. Let's say an arch is a piece from 0 to 1 to 0.\n$x(y)$ starts at 1, goes through 12 arches, ends at 1.\n$h(z^y_i)=1 > z^y_i$. $h(m_i)=1 > m_i$ (unless $m_i=1$).\nLet $y_k$ be the $k$-th zero of $x(y)$. Let $x_k$ be the point in $[z^y_i, m_i]$ where $y(x_k)=y_k$.\n$h(x_k)=0 < x_k$.\n$h(x)$ goes $1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to \\dots \\to 0 \\to 1$.\nThe line $g(x)=x$ must be crossed once going down and once going up for each arch.\nSo each arch of $x(y)$ leads to 2 solutions. $12 \\times 2 = 24$.\nThis is correct.\nSo on $[z^y_i, m_i]$, there are 24 solutions. On $[m_i, z^y_{i+1}]$, there are 24 solutions.

"Let the given equations be\n(1) $y = 4 g(f(\\sin (2 \\pi x)))$\n(2) $x = 4 g(f(\\cos (3 \\pi y)))$\n\nThe functions are $f(t)=|| t|-\\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(t)=|| t|-\\tfrac{1}{4}|$.\nLet's define a composite function $H(t) = 4g(f(t))$.\n$f(t) = ||t| - 1/2|$. Since the arguments are $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ and $\\cos(3\\pi y)$, let's denote the argument as $z \\in [-1, 1]$.\nThen $|z| \\in [0,1]$, so $f(z) = ||z|-1/2| \\in [0, 1/2]$.\nLet $u=f(z) \\in [0,1/2]$.\n$g(u) = ||u|-1/4|$. Since $u \\ge 0$, this is $|u-1/4|$.\nSo $g(f(z)) = |f(z)-1/4| = |||z|-1/2|-1/4|$.\nThe range of $g(f(z))$ for $z \\in [-1,1]$ is $[0,1/4]$.\nThe function $H(z) = 4|||z|-1/2|-1/4|$. Its range is $[0,1]$.\nThe system of equations can be written as:\n(1) $y = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$\n(2) $x = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$\n\nWe are looking for the number of intersection points $(x,y)$ of these two graphs in the square $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$, since the ranges of $H$ imply $x,y \\in [0,1]$.\n\nLet's analyze the function $H(t)$ for $t \\in [-1,1]$. $H(t)$ is an even function, so we can analyze it for $t \\in [0,1]$.\n$H(t) = 4||t-1/2|-1/4|$ for $t \\in [0,1]$.\n- If $t \\in [0, 1/4]$, $H(t) = 4|-(t-1/2)-1/4| = 4|1/4-t| = 1-4t$.\n- If $t \\in [1/4, 1/2]$, $H(t) = 4|-(t-1/2)-1/4| = 4|t-1/4| = 4t-1$.\n- If $t \\in [1/2, 3/4]$, $H(t) = 4|(t-1/2)-1/4| = 4|t-3/4| = 3-4t$.\n- If $t \\in [3/4, 1]$, $H(t) = 4|(t-1/2)-1/4| = 4|t-3/4| = 4t-3$.\nThe graph of $H(t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ is a triangular wave. It starts at $H(0)=1$, goes down to $H(1/4)=0$, up to $H(1/2)=1$, down to $H(3/4)=0$, and up to $H(1)=1$.\nThe graph of $H(t)$ on $[0,1]$ consists of 4 monotonic segments. We can say $H(t)$ performs 2 full oscillations on $[0,1]$.\n\nLet's analyze the equation $y = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$. Since $H$ is even, this is $y = H(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)$.\nLet $t(x) = |\\sin(2\\pi x)|$. As $x$ goes from $0$ to $1$, the value of $t(x)$ goes through the interval $[0,1]$ and back, twice.\n- $x \\in [0, 1/2]$: $t(x) = \\sin(2\\pi x)$ goes from $0$ to $1$ and back to $0$.\n- $x \\in [1/2, 1]$: $t(x) = |\\sin(2\\pi x)|$ goes from $0$ to $1$ and back to $0$.\nAs $t$ goes from $0$ to $1$, $H(t)$ performs 2 oscillations.\nSo, as $t(x)$ goes $0 \\to 1 \\to 0$, the function $y(x) = H(t(x))$ performs $2 \\times 2 = 4$ oscillations.\nOver the full range $x \\in [0,1]$, $y(x)$ performs $4 \\times 2 = 8$ full oscillations. An oscillation here means a \"hump\" starting from $y=0$, going to $y=1$ and back to $y=0$. The function $y(x)$ starts at $y(0)=H(0)=1$, so it's more like it has $8$ \"dips\" from $y=1$ to $y=0$ and back to $y=1$.\n\nLet's analyze the equation $x = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$, which is $x = H(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|)$.\nLet $u(y) = |\\cos(3\\pi y)|$. As $y$ goes from $0$ to $1$, the value of $3\\pi y$ goes from $0$ to $3\\pi$.\nThe function $|\\cos(\\theta)|$ has a period of $\\pi$. So in the range $[0, 3\\pi]$, it completes 3 full cycles.\nIn each cycle (e.g., $\\theta \\in [0,\\pi]$), $|\\cos(\\theta)|$ goes from $1$ to $0$ and back to $1$.\nAs $u$ goes $1 \\to 0 \\to 1$, $H(u)$ performs $2 \\times 2 = 4$ oscillations (dips).\nSo, as $y$ goes from $0$ to $1$, $u(y)$ completes 3 cycles of $1 \\to 0 \\to 1$.\nThus, $x(y) = H(u(y))$ performs $4 \\times 3 = 12$ full oscillations (dips).\n\nTo find the number of intersections, we can solve the system by substitution.\nLet $K(x) = H(\\cos(3\\pi H(\\sin(2\\pi x))))$. The solutions are the fixed points of $K$, i.e., $x=K(x)$.\nLet's count the number of monotonic sections of $K(x)$ for $x \\in [0,1]$.\nLet's denote $N(f)$ as the number of monotonic sections of a function $f$ on its domain.\n1. Let $f_1(x) = |\\sin(2\\pi x)|$ for $x \\in [0,1]$. As seen before, $t=f_1(x)$ goes $0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0$. This function has 4 monotonic sections on $[0,1]$.\n2. Let $f_2(t) = H(t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$. This function has 4 monotonic sections.\nThe composition $y_0(x) = f_2(f_1(x))$ will have $N(f_1) \\times N(f_2) = 4 \\times 4 = 16$ monotonic sections. In each section, the function goes from a value in $\\{0,1\\}$ to a value in $\\{0,1\\}$.\n3. Let $f_3(y_0) = |\\cos(3\\pi y_0)|$ for $y_0 \\in [0,1]$. As $y_0$ goes from $0$ to $1$, $3\\pi y_0$ goes from $0$ to $3\\pi$. $|\\cos|$ completes 3 cycles, but each cycle $1\\to 0 \\to 1$ consists of 2 monotonic parts. So $3 \\times 2 = 6$ monotonic sections.\nThe composition $v(x) = f_3(y_0(x))$ has $N(y_0) \\times N(f_3) = 16 \\times 6 = 96$ monotonic sections.\n4. Let $f_4(v) = H(v)$ for $v \\in [0,1]$. This function has 4 monotonic sections.\nThe final composition $K(x) = f_4(v(x))$ has $N(v) \\times N(f_4) = 96 \\times 4 = 384$ monotonic sections.\n\nThe function $K(x)$ is continuous on $[0,1]$. The graph of $y=K(x)$ consists of 384 monotonic segments. Let the endpoints of these segments be $0=x_0 < x_1 < \\dots < x_{384}=1$.\nThe value of $K(x_i)$ is either 0 or 1 for all $i=0, \\dots, 384$. This is because the segments are separated by points where one of the arguments to $H$ is $1/4, 1/2, 3/4$, or an argument to $|\\sin|$ or $|\\cos|$ is a multiple of $\\pi/2$. The values of $H$ at these critical points are 0 or 1.\n\nWe want to find the number of solutions to $K(x)=x$.\nLet's check the endpoints of the domain $[0,1]$.\n$K(0) = H(\\cos(3\\pi H(\\sin(0)))) = H(\\cos(3\\pi H(0))) = H(\\cos(3\\pi \\cdot 1)) = H(-1) = H(1) = 1$.\nSo at $x=0$, $K(0)=1$. The graph starts at $(0,1)$.\n$K(1) = H(\\cos(3\\pi H(\\sin(2\\pi)))) = H(\\cos(3\\pi H(0))) = H(\\cos(3\\pi)) = H(-1) = H(1) = 1$.\nSo at $x=1$, $K(1)=1$. The graph ends at $(1,1)$. So $x=1$ is a solution.\n\nConsider an interval $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$ where $K(x)$ is monotonic. $x_i, x_{i+1} \\in (0,1)$.\n$K(x_i) \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and $K(x_{i+1}) \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\nIf $K(x_i) \\neq K(x_{i+1)}$, one of them is 0 and the other is 1.\nLet's check the function $\\phi(x) = K(x)-x$.\n$\\phi(x_i) = K(x_i) - x_i$. Since $x_i \\in (0,1)$, $K(x_i)$ is either $0-x_i < 0$ or $1-x_i > 0$.\n$\\phi(x_{i+1}) = K(x_{i+1}) - x_{i+1}$. This will have the opposite sign of $\\phi(x_i)$.\nFor example, if $K(x_i)=0$ and $K(x_{i+1})=1$, then $\\phi(x_i) = -x_i < 0$ and $\\phi(x_{i+1}) = 1-x_{i+1} > 0$.\nSince $\\phi(x)$ is continuous, there must be a root in $(x_i, x_{i+1})$. As $K(x)$ is monotonic on this interval, $K(x)-x$ is also monotonic (since its derivative $K'(x)-1$ does not change sign, as $|K'(x)|$ is very large), so there is exactly one root.\n\nThis argument holds for almost all 384 segments. Let's analyze the overall structure of $K(x)$.\nThe function $y_0(x)=H(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)$ performs 8 dips, starting from $y_0(0)=1$ and ending at $y_0(1)=1$.\nThe function $v(y_0)=|\\cos(3\\pi y_0)|$ performs 3 cycles for $y_0 \\in [0,1]$.\nThe function $K(v)=H(v)$ performs 2 cycles for $v \\in [0,1]$.\nThe total number of full dips of $K(x)$ from 1 to 0 and back to 1 is $8 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 48$.\nWait, let's re-evaluate the number of oscillations.\n$y_0(x)$: 8 oscillations on $[0,1]$.\n$v(y_0)$: As $y_0$ makes one trip $1 \\to 0 \\to 1$, $v(y_0)$ makes 3 trips $1 \\to 0 \\to 1$.\n$K(v)$: As $v$ makes one trip $1 \\to 0 \\to 1$, $K(v)$ makes 2 trips $1 \\to 0 \\to 1$.\nSo $K(x)$ performs $8 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 48$ trips $1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to \\dots \\to 1$.\nLet's check the number of monotonic sections again.\n$y_0(x)$: $t=|\\sin(2\\pi x)|$ is 4 sections $0\\leftrightarrow 1$. $H(t)$ is 4 sections $0\\leftrightarrow 1$. $4\\times 4=16$.\n$v(y_0)$: $y_0$ is 16 sections $0\\leftrightarrow 1$. $|\\cos(3\\pi y_0)|$ is 6 sections $0\\leftrightarrow 1$. $16\\times 6=96$.\n$K(v)$: $v$ is 96 sections $0\\leftrightarrow 1$. $H(v)$ is 4 sections $0\\leftrightarrow 1$. $96\\times 4=384$.\nThe number of monotonic sections is indeed 384.\n\nThe graph of $K(x)$ starts at $(0,1)$ and ends at $(1,1)$. It consists of 384 monotonic pieces, with endpoints having y-coordinates 0 or 1.\nLet's consider the sequence of values $K(x_i)$ for $i=0, \\dots, 384$.\n$K(x_0)=1$. $K(x_1)$ must be 0. $K(x_2)=1$. And so on.\nThe sequence of values is $1,0,1,0, \\dots, 1,0,1$.\nThere are 384 intervals.\n$\\phi(x_0) = K(0)-0 = 1 > 0$.\n$\\phi(x_1) = K(x_1)-x_1 = -x_1 < 0$. One root in $(x_0, x_1)$.\n$\\phi(x_2) = K(x_2)-x_2 = 1-x_2 > 0$. One root in $(x_1, x_2)$.\n...\n$\\phi(x_{383}) = K(x_{383})-x_{383} = -x_{383} < 0$. One root in $(x_{382}, x_{383})$.\n$\\phi(x_{384}) = K(1)-1 = 0$. So $x=1$ is a solution.\nThe last interval is $[x_{383}, x_{384}]$.\n$\\phi(x_{383}) < 0$ and $\\phi(x_{384})=0$.\nSince $K'(1)=0$ (as calculated in thought process), $K(x) \\approx 1 - C(1-x)^2$ for some $C>0$ near $x=1$.\nSo $K(x)-x \\approx 1-C(1-x)^2 - x = (1-x) - C(1-x)^2 = (1-x)(1-C(1-x))$.\nFor $x$ close to 1, this is positive. So $\\phi(x)>0$ for $x \\to 1^-$.\nThis means there must be another root in $(x_{383}, 1)$.\nSo we have one root in each of the 383 intervals $(x_i, x_{i+1})$ for $i=0, \\dots, 382$. That's 383 roots.\nAnd in the last interval $(x_{383}, 1)$, we have one root, plus the root at $x=1$.\nLet's re-examine $\\phi(x)$ on $[x_{383}, 1]$. $K(x_{383})=0$. $\\phi(x_{383}) < 0$. $K(1)=1$. $\\phi(1)=0$.\n$K(x)$ is monotonic on $[x_{383}, 1]$, increasing from 0 to 1.\nThe function $\\phi(x)=K(x)-x$ goes from a negative value to 0.\nIt must cross zero inside the interval if its slope at the endpoint is not right.\n$\\phi'(x) = K'(x)-1$. $\\phi'(1) = K'(1)-1 = 0-1=-1$.\nSince $\\phi(1)=0$ and $\\phi'(1)=-1$, for $x$ just less than 1, $\\phi(x)$ must be positive.\nSo $\\phi(x_{383}) < 0$ and $\\phi(1^-) > 0$. This guarantees a root in $(x_{383}, 1)$.\nAnd $x=1$ is also a solution. So the last interval gives 2 solutions.\nWhat about the first interval $[0, x_1]$? $K(0)=1, K(x_1)=0$. $\\phi(0)=1>0, \\phi(x_1)=-x_1<0$. One root.\nSo we have 383 intervals giving one root each, and the last interval gives two.\nTotal: $383+1=384$? No, $383 \\times 1 + 1 = 384$?\nLet's count intervals. There are 384 intervals.\nIntervals $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$ for $i=0, \\dots, 382$. That's 383 intervals. Each has one root.\nInterval $[x_{383}, 1]$. It has one root inside and one at the boundary. That's 2 roots.\nTotal number of solutions is $383+1=384$? No, $383 \\times 1 + 2 = 385$?\nLet's check again.\n$i=0, \\dots, 383$. Total 384 intervals.\n$\\phi(x_0)>0, \\phi(x_1)<0 \\implies$ root in $(x_0,x_1)$.\n$\\phi(x_1)<0, \\phi(x_2)>0 \\implies$ root in $(x_1,x_2)$.\n...\n$\\phi(x_{383})<0, \\phi(x_{384})=0$.\nThe function $K(x)$ is increasing on $[x_{383}, 1]$.\nWe have $\\phi(x_{383}) < 0$ and $\\phi(1)=0$.\nAs shown $\\phi(1-\\epsilon)>0$. So there is a root in $(x_{383}, 1)$.\nSo the solutions are $r_0, r_1, \\dots, r_{382}$ where $r_i \\in (x_i, x_{i+1})$, and $r_{383} \\in (x_{383}, 1)$, and $r_{384}=1$.\nThis gives $384+1=385$ solutions?\nLet's check if any $x_i$ can be a solution. $K(x_i)=x_i$.\n$K(x_i)$ is 0 or 1. $x_i \\in (0,1)$. So this cannot happen.\nSo all solutions are in the interior of the intervals, except for $x=1$.\nSo we have 384 intervals. Each of the first 383 gives one solution. The last one gives one interior solution and one boundary solution.\nTotal is $383+2=385$.\nWait, $\\phi(x_{383}) = K(x_{383}) - x_{383} = 0 - x_{383} < 0$.\n$K(x)$ on $[x_{383}, 1]$ is monotonic increasing from 0 to 1.\nSo there is exactly one solution to $K(x)=x$ in $[x_{383}, 1]$.\nLet's see. $\\phi(x_{383}) < 0$. $\\phi(1)=0$. $\\phi'(1)=-1$.\nThe function $\\phi(x)$ starts negative, increases, and must become positive before coming down to 0 at $x=1$.\nThis means $K(x)-x$ is not monotonic. But $K(x)$ is monotonic on $[x_{383}, 1]$.\n$K'(x) > 0$ on $(x_{383}, 1)$.\n$\\phi'(x) = K'(x)-1$. For $\\phi(x)$ to have a turning point, $K'(x)$ must be 1.\nThe slope of $K(x)$ can be very large, so it's possible.\nLet's re-evaluate the number of solutions per dip.\nA dip of $K(x)$ from 1 to 0 and back to 1 must cross the line $y=x$ twice.\nThere are $384/2=192$ such dips.\nThe graph starts at $(0,1)$ and ends at $(1,1)$.\nThe first dip is on $[0, x_2]$. $K(0)=1, K(x_1)=0, K(x_2)=1$.\n$\\phi(0)=1>0$. $\\phi(x_1)=-x_1<0$. Root in $(0,x_1)$.\n$\\phi(x_2)=1-x_2>0$. Root in $(x_1,x_2)$.\nSo each dip gives 2 solutions.\nThere are 192 dips. The last one is on $[x_{382}, 1]$.\n$K(x_{382})=1, K(x_{383})=0, K(1)=1$.\n$\\phi(x_{382})=1-x_{382}>0$.\n$\\phi(x_{383})=-x_{383}<0$. Root in $(x_{382}, x_{383})$.\n$\\phi(1)=0$. So $x=1$ is a root.\nWe need to know if there is another root in $(x_{383}, 1)$.\nThis is the same question as before. $\\phi(x_{383})<0, \\phi(1)=0, \\phi'(1)<0$.\nThis implies $\\phi(x)$ was positive for $x$ just before 1.\nSo there must be another root in $(x_{383}, 1)$.\nSo the last dip gives 3 solutions: one in $(x_{382}, x_{383})$, one in $(x_{383}, 1)$ and $x=1$.\nIs it possible? $K(x)$ is monotonic on $[x_{383}, 1]$.\n$K(x)-x=0$ can only have one solution if $K'(x)-1$ does not change sign.\nLet's check $K'(x)$ on this last interval.\n$x$ is close to 1. $t=|\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\approx 2\\pi(1-x)$.\n$y_0=H(t) \\approx 1-4(2\\pi(1-x)) = 1-8\\pi(1-x)$.\n$v=|\\cos(3\\pi y_0)| \\approx |\\cos(3\\pi-24\\pi^2(1-x))| \\approx 1-\\frac{1}{2}(24\\pi^2(1-x))^2$.\n$v$ is in $[3/4, 1]$ for $x$ close to 1.\n$K(x)=H(v)=4v-3 \\approx 4(1-288\\pi^4(1-x)^2)-3 = 1-1152\\pi^4(1-x)^2$.\n$K'(x) = 2304\\pi^4(1-x)$. $K'(1)=0$.\nThe equation $K'(x)=1$ becomes $2304\\pi^4(1-x)=1$, which has a solution $x=1-1/(2304\\pi^4)$ very close to 1.\nSo $\\phi'(x)=K'(x)-1$ does change sign in the last interval.\nThe function $\\phi(x)$ on $[x_{383}, 1]$ starts negative, increases (as $K'(x)$ is large), crosses zero, reaches a maximum where $K'(x)=1$, then decreases to 0 at $x=1$.\nSo there are two solutions in $[x_{383}, 1]$.\nSo the last dip gives 3 solutions.\nNumber of dips is 192.\nThe first 191 dips give $191 \\times 2 = 382$ solutions.\nThe last dip gives 3 solutions.\nTotal is $382+3=385$.\nLet me check the first dip. $K(0)=1$. $K'(0)=0$.\n$K(x) \\approx 1-C x^2$ for small $x$.\n$\\phi(x) = 1-Cx^2-x$. $\\phi(0)=1$. $\\phi'(0)=-1$.\nThe first dip is on $[0, x_2]$.\n$\\phi(0)=1$. $\\phi(x_1)=-x_1<0$. One root.\n$\\phi(x_2)=1-x_2>0$.\nOn $[x_1, x_2]$, $K(x)$ is increasing. $K'(x_1)$ is large, $K'(x_2)$ is large.\n$K'(x)-1=0$ could have solutions.\nIt seems each of the 192 dips gives 2 solutions, for a total of 384.\nThe tangent business at the end points might reduce the count if not careful.\n$K'(0)=0, K'(1)=0$.\nAt $x=0$, $\\phi(0)=1, \\phi'(0)=-1$. The curve $y=K(x)$ starts at $(0,1)$ with zero slope, so it's above $y=x$.\nAt $x=1$, $\\phi(1)=0, \\phi'(1)=-1$. The curve $y=K(x)$ arrives at $(1,1)$ with zero slope, so it comes from above $y=x$.\nLet's trace the graph of $\\phi(x)$. $\\phi(0)=1$. It goes down, crosses 0. Then up, crosses 0.\n$\\phi(x_i)$ alternates sign for $i=1, ..., 383$.\n$\\phi(0)=1, \\phi(x_1)<0, \\phi(x_2)>0, ..., \\phi(x_{382})>0, \\phi(x_{383})<0, \\phi(1)=0$.\nNumber of guaranteed roots is 383 in $(0,1)$. Plus $x=1$. Total 384.\nThis assumes that in each interval $(x_i, x_{i+1})$, there is only one root.\nThis is true if $\\phi'(x)$ does not change sign. $\\phi'(x)=K'(x)-1$.\nThe slope $|K'(x)|$ can be very large, so $K'(x)$ is either very positive or very negative. So $K'(x)-1$ will not change sign in the middle of a monotonic segment of $K(x)$.\nThe sign change can only happen near the points where $|K'(x)|$ is small, which is near the endpoints $x=0,1$.\nWe checked near $x=1$ and found $K'(x)$ goes from large to 0. So $K'(x)=1$ is crossed.\nThis gives an extra solution.\nHow many extra solutions? One for each end?\n$K'(0)=0$. $K'(x)$ for $x$ near 0: $K(x) \\approx 1-1152\\pi^4 x^2$. $K'(x) \\approx -2304\\pi^4 x$.\n$K'(x)=1$ has no solution for small $x$.\nSo the first dip on $[0,x_2]$ gives 2 solutions.\nThe last dip on $[x_{382}, 1]$ gives 3 solutions.\n$190$ dips in between give $190 \\times 2 = 380$ solutions.\nTotal: $2+380+3=385$.\nThis seems too specific. Maybe there is a simpler picture.\n$8 \\times 12 \\times 2 = 192$. This is based on a simpler model.\n$8 \\times 12 \\times 4 = 384$.\nNumber of humps of $y(x)$ is 8. Number of humps of $x(y)$ is 12.\nEach $V_i$ and $H_j$ intersect. How many times?\nLet's reconsider $x=H(V(x))$ on $[x_1,x_2]$.\n$V(x)$ goes $0 \\to 1 \\to 0$.\n$H(V(x))$ goes $1 \\to (1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1) \\to 1$.\nThe graph of $H(V(x))$ has 4 valleys at $y=0$.\nThe line $y=x$ must cross these 4 downward parts.\nAnd since the function ends at 1, it must cross the 4 upward parts.\nSo 8 intersections. $8 \\times 12 \\times 8 = 768$.\n\nLet's go back to the number of monotonic sections of $K(x)$ being 384.\nThe number of solutions of $f(x)=x$ for a function with $N$ monotonic sections from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 is $N$.\n$K(0)=1, K(1)=1$.\nThe graph of $K(x)$ starts at $(0,1)$ and ends at $(1,1)$. It consists of 384 monotonic segments, connecting points with y-coordinate 0 or 1.\nThis means the graph is a sequence of 192 U-shapes, starting from $(0,1)$, going to some $(x_1,0)$, then $(x_2,1)$, etc.\nThe last U-shape ends at $(1,1)$.\nEach U-shape is composed of two monotonic segments.\nA U-shape from $(x_{2k}, 1)$ to $(x_{2k+2}, 1)$ through $(x_{2k+1}, 0)$ must intersect the line $y=x$ twice, as $x_{2k}, x_{2k+1}, x_{2k+2}$ are all in $(0,1)$.\nSo $192 \\times 2 = 384$ solutions.\nThis holds for all U-shapes whose domain is in $(0,1)$.\nThe first U-shape is on $[0, x_2]$. It starts at $(0,1)$, goes to $(x_1,0)$, ends at $(x_2,1)$.\nIt must cross $y=x$ twice.\nThe last U-shape is on $[x_{382}, 1]$. Starts at $(x_{382},1)$, goes to $(x_{383},0)$, ends at $(1,1)$.\nIt must cross $y=x$ twice. One point is $x=1$. The other is in $(x_{382}, x_{383})$.\nLet's check the crossing in $(x_{383},1)$. $K(x)$ goes from 0 to 1. $K(x_{383})=0, K(1)=1$.\n$K(x)-x=0$. $K(x_{383})-x_{383} < 0$. $K(1)-1=0$.\nIf $K(x)$ is convex, there is one solution $x=1$. If concave, two.\n$K''(x) = -2304\\pi^4$. It's concave. So two solutions.\nSo the last U-shape gives 3 solutions.\nThe first U-shape on $[0,x_2]$. $K(0)=1, K(x_1)=0, K(x_2)=1$.\n$K(x)$ on $[0,x_1]$ is decreasing. $K(0)=1, K(x_1)=0$. $K(x)=x$ has one solution.\n$K(x)$ on $[x_1,x_2]$ is increasing. $K(x_1)=0, K(x_2)=1$. $K(x)=x$ has one solution.\nSo 2 solutions.\nSo all 192 U-shapes give 2 solutions each.\nTotal $192 \\times 2 = 384$.\n\nFinal check on the last U-shape on $[x_{382}, 1]$.\nIt consists of two monotonic parts: $[x_{382}, x_{383}]$ and $[x_{383}, 1]$.\nOn $[x_{382}, x_{383}]$, $K(x)$ goes from 1 to 0. $K(x_{382})=1, K(x_{383})=0$.\n$K(x_{382})-x_{382} > 0$. $K(x_{383})-x_{383} < 0$. One solution.\nOn $[x_{383}, 1]$, $K(x)$ goes from 0 to 1. $K(x_{383})=0, K(1)=1$.\n$K(x_{383})-x_{383} < 0$. $K(1)-1=0$.\n$K(x)$ is concave on this interval. A concave function can only intersect a line twice.\nThe line is $y=x$. The function $K(x)$ starts below the line and ends on the line.\nIt must cross the line to get above it, and then come back down to meet it.\nBut $K(x)$ is monotonic increasing. So it cannot come back down.\nSo it stays below $y=x$ until it hits $x=1$.\nExample: $y=\\sqrt{x}$ on $[0,1]$. $y(0)=0, y(1)=1$. Below $y=x$ for $x \\in (0,1)$.\nExample: $y=x^2$ on $[0,1]$. $y(0)=0, y(1)=1$. Below $y=x$.\nExample: $y=2x-x^2$ on $[0,1]$. $y(0)=0, y(1)=1$. Above $y=x$.\nHere we have $K(x_{383})=0, K(1)=1$. $K(x)$ is concave.\nThe curve is above the chord from $(x_{383},0)$ to $(1,1)$.\nThe line $y=x$ is above this chord.\nSo we can't say for sure.\nBut we know $K(1)=1$ is a solution and $K'(1)=0 < 1$. So for $x<1$ near 1, $K(x)>x$.\n$K(x_{383})=0 < x_{383}$.\nSo there must be at least one solution in $(x_{383}, 1)$.\nSince $K(x)$ is monotonic, there is exactly one.\nSo the last U-shape gives $1+1=2$ solutions.\nSo all 192 U-shapes give 2 solutions. Total 384.\n\n"

"Let the given equations be\n(1) $y = 4 g(f(\\sin (2 \\pi x)))$\n(2) $x = 4 g(f(\\cos (3 \\pi y)))$\n\nThe functions $f$ and $g$ are defined as $f(u)=|| u|-\\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(v)=|| v|-\\tfrac{1}{4}|$.\nLet's define a composite function $H(t) = 4g(f(t))$.\n$H(t) = 4|||t|-\\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4}|$.\nThe given system of equations can be written as:\n(1) $y = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$\n(2) $x = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$\n\nLet's analyze the function $H(t)$.\n$H(t)$ is an even function, i.e., $H(-t) = H(t)$.\nThe range of $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ is $[-1, 1]$ and the range of $\\cos(3\\pi y)$ is $[-1, 1]$. So we are interested in $H(t)$ for $t \\in [-1, 1]$.\nFor $t \\in [-1, 1]$, we have $|t| \\in [0, 1]$. Let $u=|t|$.\n$f(t) = |u - 1/2|$. The range of $f(t)$ for $t \\in [-1, 1]$ is $[0, 1/2]$.\nLet $v = f(t) \\in [0, 1/2]$.\n$g(v) = |v - 1/4|$. The range of $g(v)$ for $v \\in [0, 1/2]$ is $[0, 1/4]$.\nSo, $H(t) = 4g(f(t))$ has a range of $4 \\times [0, 1/4] = [0, 1]$.\nFrom the equations, we can see that $x \\in [0, 1]$ and $y \\in [0, 1]$. We only need to find the number of intersections in the unit square $[0, 1] \\times [0, 1]$.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the graphs of the two equations.\nLet $Y(x) = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ and $X(y) = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$.\nThe number of intersections is the number of solutions to the system $y=Y(x)$ and $x=X(y)$.\nThis is equivalent to finding the number of solutions to the equation $x = X(Y(x))$ for $x \\in [0, 1]$.\nLet $F(x) = X(Y(x))$. We need to count the number of solutions to $x=F(x)$.\n\nLet's analyze the number of \"wiggles\" or monotonic sections for $Y(x)$ and $X(y)$.\nThe number of monotonic sections of $H(t)$ for $t \\in [-1, 1]$:\n$H(t) = 4|||t|-1/2|-1/4|$. The function changes monotonicity at its critical points, which are the points where the expression inside an absolute value becomes zero.\n$t=0$.\n$|t|-1/2=0 \\implies t = \\pm 1/2$.\n$||t|-1/2|-1/4=0 \\implies |t|-1/2 = \\pm 1/4 \\implies |t|=3/4$ or $|t|=1/4 \\implies t=\\pm 1/4, \\pm 3/4$.\nThe critical points for $H(t)$ in $[-1, 1]$ are $t \\in \\{-1, -3/4, -1/2, -1/4, 0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1\\}$.\nThis gives 8 intervals in $[-1, 1]$. In each interval, $H(t)$ is monotonic. So $H(t)$ has 8 monotonic sections for $t \\in [-1,1]$.\n\nLet's analyze $Y(x) = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ for $x \\in [0, 1]$.\nThe number of monotonic sections of $Y(x)$ is determined by the number of monotonic sections of $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ and $H(t)$.\nThe function $u(x) = \\sin(2\\pi x)$ is monotonic on $[0, 1/4], [1/4, 3/4], [3/4, 1]$.\nThe range of $u(x)$ on $[0, 1/4]$ is $[0, 1]$. On this interval, $H(t)$ has 4 monotonic sections. So $Y(x)$ has 4 monotonic sections on $[0, 1/4]$.\nThe range on $[1/4, 3/4]$ is $[1, -1]$. On this interval, $H(t)$ has 8 monotonic sections. So $Y(x)$ has 8 monotonic sections on $[1/4, 3/4]$.\nThe range on $[3/4, 1]$ is $[-1, 0]$. On this interval, $H(t)$ has 4 monotonic sections. So $Y(x)$ has 4 monotonic sections on $[3/4, 1]$.\nTotal number of monotonic sections for $Y(x)$ is $4+8+4=16$.\nThis means the graph of $y=Y(x)$ consists of 16 monotonic pieces. This corresponds to $16/2=8$ \"wiggles\".\n\nLet's analyze $X(y) = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$ for $y \\in [0, 1]$.\nThe function $v(y) = \\cos(3\\pi y)$ is monotonic on $[0, 1/3], [1/3, 2/3], [2/3, 1]$.\nThe range of $v(y)$ on $[0, 1/3]$ is $[1, -1]$. $H(t)$ has 8 monotonic sections for $t \\in [-1, 1]$. So $X(y)$ has 8 monotonic sections on $[0, 1/3]$.\nThe range on $[1/3, 2/3]$ is $[-1, 1]$. So $X(y)$ has 8 monotonic sections on $[1/3, 2/3]$.\nThe range on $[2/3, 1]$ is $[1, -1]$. So $X(y)$ has 8 monotonic sections on $[2/3, 1]$.\nTotal number of monotonic sections for $X(y)$ is $8+8+8=24$.\nThis means the graph of $x=X(y)$ consists of 24 monotonic pieces, which corresponds to $24/2=12$ \"wiggles\".\n\nNow we study the solutions of $x=F(x)=X(Y(x))$.\nLet's determine the number of monotonic sections of $F(x)$.\n$Y(x)$ has 16 monotonic sections on $[0,1]$. Let's consider one such section, on an interval $I_k$. The range of $Y(x)$ on $I_k$ is either $[0,1]$ or $[1,0]$.\nThe function $X(y)$ has 24 monotonic sections on $[0,1]$.\nSo for each interval $I_k$ where $Y(x)$ is monotonic, the composite function $F(x)=X(Y(x))$ will have 24 monotonic sections.\nThe total number of monotonic sections for $F(x)$ on $[0,1]$ is $16 \\times 24 = 384$.\nThis corresponds to $384/2 = 192$ \"wiggles\" for the graph of $y=F(x)$.\n\nTo find the number of intersections, we need to find the number of solutions to $F(x)=x$. This is the number of intersection points of the graph of $y=F(x)$ and the line $y=x$.\nLet's check the values at the endpoints $x=0$ and $x=1$.\n$Y(0) = H(\\sin(0)) = H(0) = 4||0-1/2|-1/4| = 4|1/2-1/4|=1$.\n$F(0) = X(Y(0)) = X(1) = H(\\cos(3\\pi)) = H(-1) = 4||-1|-1/2|-1/4| = 4|1/2-1/4|=1$.\nSo, $F(0)=1$. The graph of $y=F(x)$ starts at $(0,1)$.\n$Y(1) = H(\\sin(2\\pi)) = H(0) = 1$.\n$F(1) = X(Y(1)) = X(1) = 1$.\nSo, $F(1)=1$. The graph of $y=F(x)$ ends at $(1,1)$.\n\nThe line $y=x$ goes from $(0,0)$ to $(1,1)$.\nThe graph of $y=F(x)$ goes from $(0,1)$ to $(1,1)$.\nAt $x=0$, $F(0)=1 > 0$. The graph starts above the line $y=x$.\nAt $x=1$, $F(1)=1$. The graph intersects the line $y=x$ at $x=1$.\n\nThe range of $F(x)=X(Y(x))$ is $[0,1]$. The graph of $y=F(x)$ oscillates between 0 and 1.\nThe function $F(x)$ has 192 wiggles. Let's analyze the shape of these wiggles.\nThe local maxima of $Y(x)$ occur when $|\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$, where $H$ reaches its maximum value 1.\nThe local minima of $Y(x)$ occur when $|\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\in \\{1/4, 3/4\\}$, where $H$ reaches its minimum value 0.\nSimilarly, the local maxima of $X(y)$ are 1 (at $|\\cos(3\\pi y)| \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$) and minima are 0 (at $|\\cos(3\\pi y)| \\in \\{1/4, 3/4\\}$).\nSo, the maxima of $F(x)=X(Y(x))$ are $X(1)=1$ or $X(0)=1$. Thus, the maximum value of $F(x)$ is 1.\nThe minima of $F(x)$ are $X(y_{min})$ where $y_{min}$ is a minimum of $Y(x)$. The minima of $Y(x)$ are 0. So the minimum value of $F(x)$ is $X(0)=1$. This is not right.\nThe minima of $F(x)$ occur when $Y(x)$ is a value $y_0$ for which $X(y_0)$ is minimal. The minimal value of $X(y)$ is 0. This happens for several $y_0$. We need to check if $Y(x)$ can take these values. The range of $Y(x)$ is $[0,1]$, which is the full domain of $X(y)$. So $F(x)$ will have minimum value 0.\nThe graph of $y=F(x)$ oscillates between 0 and 1. It does this 192 times.\nEach \"wiggle\" can be seen as the graph going from a maximum value of 1 to a minimum of 0 and back to 1.\nLet's consider one such wiggle, starting from a maximum at $x_i$ and ending at the next maximum at $x_{j}$. $F(x_i)=1, F(x_j)=1$. Somewhere in between, at $x_k$, $F(x_k)=0$.\nThe line $y=x$ is between $y=0$ and $y=1$ for $x \\in (0,1)$.\nAt $x_i$, $F(x_i)=1 \\ge x_i$. The inequality is strict for $x_i<1$.\nAt $x_k$, $F(x_k)=0 \\le x_k$. The inequality is strict for $x_k>0$.\nBy the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be an intersection point in $(x_i, x_k)$.\nSimilarly, there must be an intersection point in $(x_k, x_j)$.\nSo, each of the 192 wiggles typically contains two intersection points. This gives $192 \\times 2 = 384$ solutions.\n\nLet's verify the endpoints. The graph starts at $(0,1)$ and ends at $(1,1)$.\nThe first wiggle starts at $x=0$. $F(0)=1$. The first minimum is at some $x_1>0$. $F(x_1)=0$.\n$F(0)-0 = 1>0$. $F(x_1)-x_1 = -x_1 < 0$. So there is a root in $(0, x_1)$.\nThe first wiggle ends at some $x_2>x_1$. $F(x_2)=1$.\n$F(x_2)-x_2 = 1-x_2 > 0$ (since $x_2$ must be small, part of the first of 192 wiggles). So there is a root in $(x_1, x_2)$.\nThis confirms 2 intersections for the first wiggle.\n\nNow consider the last wiggle. The graph ends at $(1,1)$, which is a solution.\nLet's analyze the behavior of $F(x)$ near $x=1$.\n$F'(x) = X'(Y(x)) Y'(x)$.\nNear $x=1$, let $x=1-\\epsilon$ for $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$.\n$\\sin(2\\pi(1-\\epsilon)) = -\\sin(2\\pi\\epsilon) \\approx -2\\pi\\epsilon$.\n$Y(1-\\epsilon) = H(-2\\pi\\epsilon) = H(2\\pi\\epsilon)$. For small $t>0$, $H(t)=1-4t$.\nSo $Y(1-\\epsilon) \\approx 1-8\\pi\\epsilon$. So $Y'(1^-) = -8\\pi$.\n$Y(1)=1$. Near $y=1$, let $y=1-\\delta$ for $\\delta \\to 0^+$.\n$\\cos(3\\pi(1-\\delta)) = -\\cos(3\\pi\\delta) \\approx -(1-(3\\pi\\delta)^2/2) = -1+9\\pi^2\\delta^2/2$.\n$X(1-\\delta) = H(-1+9\\pi^2\\delta^2/2)$. For $t$ near $-1$, $H(t)=4|t|-3 = -4t-3$. No, $H(t)=4(t+3/4)=4t+3$ for $t \\in [-1,-3/4]$. No, $H(t)=4(-t-3/4)=-4t-3$ for $t \\in [-1,-3/4]$. No, $H(t)=4||t|-1/2|-1/4|=4(|-t-1/2|-1/4)=4(t+1/2-1/4)=4t+1$ for $t \\in [-1,-1/2]$.\n$H(t)=4(3/4+t)$ for $t \\in [-1,-3/4]$. No.\nLet's re-evaluate $H(t)$ for $t \\in [-1, -1/2]$. $|t| \\in [1/2, 1]$. $H(t)=4||t|-1/2-1/4|=4||t|-3/4|=4(-t-3/4)=-4t-3$.\nSo $X'(y) = -4 \\cdot (-3\\pi\\sin(3\\pi y))$. $X'(1)=0$.\n$F'(1^-) = X'(Y(1^-)) Y'(1^-) = X'(1) Y'(1^-) = 0 \\cdot (-8\\pi) = 0$.\nThe graph of $y=F(x)$ has a horizontal tangent at $x=1$.\nSince $F(1)=1$ and the maximum value of $F$ is 1, $(1,1)$ is a local maximum.\nThe graph of $F(x)$ is below $y=1$ for $x<1$.\nThe line $y=x$ intersects the curve at $(1,1)$. The slope of the line is 1, while the slope of the curve is 0.\nFor $x$ close to 1, $F(x) < 1$ and $x<1$. Let's check $F(x)-x$.\n$F(x) \\approx 1-c(1-x)^2$ for some $c>0$.\n$F(x)-x \\approx 1-c(1-x)^2 - x = (1-x) - c(1-x)^2 = (1-x)(1-c(1-x))$.\nFor $x$ close to 1, this is positive. So $F(x)>x$ for $x$ just less than 1.\nThe last minimum of $F(x)$ is at some $x_m<1$. $F(x_m)=0$.\n$F(x_m)-x_m = -x_m < 0$.\nSince $F(x_m)-x_m < 0$ and $F(1-\\epsilon)-(1-\\epsilon)>0$, there must be a root between $x_m$ and $1-\\epsilon$.\nAnd we already have the root $x=1$. So the last wiggle also contributes two solutions.\nEach of the 192 wiggles gives 2 solutions.\nTotal number of solutions is $192 \\times 2 = 384$.\n\n"

Let's assume $y \\in [0,1]$, which covers one and a half periods of $\\cos(3\\pi y)$. The range of $\\cos(3\\pi y)$ is $[-1,1]$.\n\nLet $s = \\sin(2\\pi x)$ and $c = \\cos(3\\pi y)$. Both $s, c \\in [-1,1]$.\nLet's analyze $H(t)$ for $t \\in [-1,1]$. Let $v = |t|$, so $v \\in [0,1]$.\n$H(t) = 4||v-\\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4}|$.\nThe range of $v-\\frac{1}{2}$ is $[-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}]$, so $|v-\\frac{1}{2}| \\in [0, \\frac{1}{2}]$.\nLet $u = |v-\\frac{1}{2}|$. The range of $u$ is $[0, \\frac{1}{2}]$.\n$H(t) = 4|u-\\frac{1}{4}|$.\nAs $u$ varies in $[0, \\frac{1}{2}]$, $u-\\frac{1}{4}$ varies in $[-\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{4}]$, so $|u-\\frac{1}{4}|$ varies in $[0, \\frac{1}{4}]$.\nThus, the range of $H(t)$ is $4 \\cdot [0, \\frac{1}{4}] = [0,1]$.\nFrom (1), $y \\in [0,1]$. From (2), $x \\in [0,1]$. So we only need to search for solutions in the unit square $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$.\n\nLet $u' = |\\sin(2\\pi x)|$ and $v' = |\\cos(3\\pi y)|$. Both $u', v' \\in [0,1]$.\nThe system of equations is:\n(1) $y = H(u')$\n(2) $x = H(v')$\nNote that $H(t)$ only depends on $|t|$, so $H(\\sin(2\\pi x)) = H(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)$.\n\nThis system is hard to solve directly. Let's introduce intermediate variables.\nLet $u = H(v')$ and $v = H(u')$.\nThe system becomes:\n(A) $y=v$\n(B) $x=u$\n(C) $u = H(v')$ where $v' = |\\cos(3\\pi y)|$\n(D) $v = H(u')$ where $u' = |\\sin(2\\pi x)|$\nSubstituting (A) and (B) into (C) and (D):\n$x = H(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|)$\n$y = H(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)$\nThis is the original system. Let's try a different substitution.\n\nLet $u = |\\sin(2\\pi x)|$ and $v = |\\cos(3\\pi y)|$.\nThe system becomes $y = H(u)$ and $x = H(v)$.\nSubstituting these into the definitions of $u$ and $v$:\n$u = |\\sin(2\\pi H(v))|$\n$v = |\\cos(3\\pi H(u))|$\n\nLet's find the number of solutions for $(u,v)$ in $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$.\nLet's define two functions $\\Phi, \\Psi: [0,1] \\to [0,1]$:\n$\\Phi(v) = |\\sin(2\\pi H(v))|$\n$\\Psi(u) = |\\cos(3\\pi H(u))|$\nWe are looking for the number of solutions to the system $u = \\Phi(v)$ and $v = \\Psi(u)$.\nThis is equivalent to finding the number of intersections of the graphs of $v=\\Psi(u)$ and $u=\\Phi(v)$ in the $u-v$ plane.\n\nLet's analyze the graph of $H(z)$ for $z \\in [0,1]$.\n$H(z) = 4||z-1/2|-1/4|$.\n$H(0)=1, H(1/4)=0, H(1/2)=1, H(3/4)=0, H(1)=1$.\nThe graph of $H(z)$ on $[0,1]$ consists of 4 V-shapes, making a \"crown\" shape. As $z$ goes from $0$ to $1$, $H(z)$ goes from $1$ to $0$, then to $1$, then to $0$, then to $1$.\n\nConsider $v = \\Psi(u) = |\\cos(3\\pi H(u))|$.\nAs $u$ sweeps the interval $[0,1]$, $H(u)$ sweeps the interval $[0,1]$ four times back and forth ($1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1$).\nWhen $H(u)$ sweeps from 0 to 1, $3\\pi H(u)$ sweeps from 0 to $3\\pi$. The function $|\\cos(\\theta)|$ completes 3 full cycles for $\\theta \\in [0,3\\pi]$.\nSo, as $H(u)$ sweeps $[0,1]$, $\\Psi(u)$ completes 3 cycles.\nSince $H(u)$ makes 4 sweeps over $[0,1]$ (in alternating directions), the graph of $\\Psi(u)$ completes $4 \\times 3 = 12$ full cycles (or \"lobes\").\n\nConsider $u = \\Phi(v) = |\\sin(2\\pi H(v))|$.\nAs $v$ sweeps $[0,1]$, $H(v)$ also sweeps $[0,1]$ four times.\nWhen $H(v)$ sweeps from 0 to 1, $2\\pi H(v)$ sweeps from 0 to $2\\pi$. The function $|\\sin(\\theta)|$ completes 2 full cycles for $\\theta \\in [0,2\\pi]$.\nSo, as $H(v)$ sweeps $[0,1]$, $\\Phi(v)$ completes 2 cycles.\nSince $H(v)$ makes 4 sweeps, the graph of $\\Phi(v)$ completes $4 \\times 2 = 8$ full cycles (lobes).\n\nThe problem is now to find the number of intersections of the graphs of $v=\\Psi(u)$ and $u=\\Phi(v)$.\nThe graph of $v=\\Psi(u)$ has 12 lobes oscillating in the $v$ direction as $u$ varies.\nThe graph of $u=\\Phi(v)$ has 8 lobes oscillating in the $u$ direction as $v$ varies.\nEach lobe of $\\Psi(u)$ is a simple curve going from $v=1$ to a minimum and back to $v=1$.\nEach lobe of $\\Phi(v)$ is a simple curve going from $u=1$ to a minimum and back to $u=1$.\nA lobe from $\\Psi(u)$ and a lobe from $\\Phi(v)$ will generally intersect at two points.\nSo, we expect $12 \\times 8 \\times 2 = 192$ intersection points in the interior of the square.\n\nLet's check the boundaries.\nIf $u=0$, $v=\\Psi(0)=|\\cos(3\\pi H(0))|=|\\cos(3\\pi)|=1$. So $(0,1)$ is on the graph of $\\Psi$.\nIs $(0,1)$ on the graph of $\\Phi$? $u=\\Phi(1)=|\\sin(2\\pi H(1))|=|\\sin(2\\pi)|=0$. Yes.\nSo, $(u,v)=(0,1)$ is an intersection point.\nIf $u=1$, $v=\\Psi(1)=|\\cos(3\\pi H(1))|=|\\cos(3\\pi)|=1$. So $(1,1)$ is on the graph of $\\Psi$.\nIs $(1,1)$ on the graph of $\\Phi$? $u=\\Phi(1)=0 \\neq 1$. No.\nIf $v=0$, $u=\\Phi(0)=|\\sin(2\\pi H(0))|=|\\sin(2\\pi)|=0$. So $(0,0)$ is on the graph of $\\Phi$.\nIs $(0,0)$ on the graph of $\\Psi$? $v=\\Psi(0)=1 \\neq 0$. No.\nIf $v=1$, $u=\\Phi(1)=0$. So $(0,1)$ is on the graph of $\\Phi$. This we already know.\n\nThe intersections on the boundary of $[0,1]^2$ only occur at $(0,1)$. A careful analysis shows the curves are not tangent there and it's a single intersection point.\nThe number of intersection points of $v=\\Psi(u)$ and $u=\\Phi(v)$ is $192+1=193$. Let's verify the $12 \\times 8 \\times 2$ figure.\nLet's consider the fixed-point equation $u = \\Phi(\\Psi(u))$.\nThe function $\\Phi(\\Psi(u))$ has $12 \\times 8 = 96$ lobes, each oscillating from 0 to 1. Each lobe must intersect the line $y=u$ twice, in general. This would give $96 \\times 2 = 192$ solutions.\nLet's assume this reasoning is sound for the generic case.\nSo we have 193 solutions for $(u,v)$.\n\nFor each solution $(u,v)$, we need to find the number of corresponding solutions $(x,y)$.\nThe equations are $u=|\\sin(2\\pi x)|$ and $v=|\\cos(3\\pi y)|$.\n\nCase 1: $(u,v) \\in (0,1) \\times (0,1)$.\nThere are $192$ such solutions.\nFor a given $u \\in (0,1)$, $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|=u$ has 4 solutions for $x \\in [0,1]$.\nFor a given $v \\in (0,1)$, $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|=v$ has 6 solutions for $y \\in [0,1]$.\nSo each $(u,v)$ point corresponds to $4 \\times 6 = 24$ points $(x,y)$.\nTotal for this case: $192 \\times 24 = 4608$.\n\nCase 2: $(u,v)$ is on the boundary.\nThe only boundary solution is $(u,v)=(0,1)$.\n$u=0 \\implies |\\sin(2\\pi x)|=0 \\implies x \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$. (3 solutions)\n$v=1 \\implies |\\cos(3\\pi y)|=1 \\implies y \\in \\{0, 1/3, 2/3, 1\\}$. (4 solutions)\nThis gives $3 \\times 4 = 12$ solutions for $(x,y)$.\n\nThe total number of intersections is $4608 + 12 = 4720$.\n\nLet's re-check the number of solutions for $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|=v$.\nFor $v \\in (0,1)$, $\\cos(3\\pi y)=v$ has 3 solutions and $\\cos(3\\pi y)=-v$ has 3 solutions in $[0,1]$. Total 6. Correct.\nFor $v=1$, $\\cos(3\\pi y)=1$ has 2 solutions ($0, 2/3$), $\\cos(3\\pi y)=-1$ has 2 solutions ($1/3, 1$). Total 4. Correct.\nFor $v=0$, $\\cos(3\\pi y)=0$ has 3 solutions ($1/6, 1/2, 5/6$). Correct.\n\nLet's re-check the number of solutions for $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|=u$.\nFor $u \\in (0,1)$, $\\sin(2\\pi x)=u$ has 2 solutions, $\\sin(2\\pi x)=-u$ has 2 solutions. Total 4. Correct.\nFor $u=1$, $\\sin(2\\pi x)=\\pm 1$ has 2 solutions ($1/4, 3/4$).\nFor $u=0$, $\\sin(2\\pi x)=0$ has 3 solutions ($0, 1/2, 1$). Correct.\n\nThe logic seems to be that we have found 193 pairs of values $(u,v)$ for $(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|, |\\cos(3\\pi y)|)$.\nLet's check my previous, more detailed analysis.\nThe number of solutions for $(u',v')=(H(u),H(v))$ was 13, where $u=|\\sin(2\\pi x)|, v=|\\cos(3\\pi y)|$.\nLet's call them $(u_s, v_s)$.\n$u_s = H(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)$, $v_s = H(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|)$.\nThe system is $y=v_s, x=u_s$.\n$u_s = H(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|) = H(|\\sin(2\\pi u_s)|)$.\n$v_s = H(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|) = H(|\\cos(3\\pi v_s)|)$.\nLet's find solutions for $z = H(|\\sin(2\\pi z)|)$.\nLet $\\Gamma(z) = H(|\\sin(2\\pi z)|)$. We want to find the number of fixed points of $\\Gamma$.\nAs $z \\in [0,1]$, $|\\sin(2\\pi z)|$ sweeps $[0,1]$ twice ($0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0$).\nAs its argument sweeps $[0,1]$, $H$ performs its crown shape.\nSo $\\Gamma(z)$ will have $2 \\times 4 = 8$ V-shapes.\nThe graph of $\\Gamma(z)$ consists of 8 lobes. The line $y=z$ must intersect each lobe.\nA lobe from $z_1$ to $z_2$ (where $\\Gamma(z_1)=\\Gamma(z_2)=1$) must intersect $y=z$ at least once.\nThe peaks of $\\Gamma(z)$ are all 1. The valleys are all 0.\nThe graph of $\\Gamma(z)$ on $[0,1]$ consists of 8 V-shapes.\nNumber of solutions for $z=\\Gamma(z)$.\n$|\\sin(2\\pi z)|$ has 2 lobes on $[0,1]$. $H$ has 4 lobes on $[0,1]$.\nThe function $\\Gamma(z)$ has $2 \\times 4 = 8$ lobes.\nEach lobe is a simple curve from a point on the boundary of $[0,1]^2$ to another, going into the interior.\nThe graph of $\\Gamma(z)$ starts at $\\Gamma(0)=H(0)=1$, ends at $\\Gamma(1)=H(0)=1$.\nIt has 8 lobes pointing down to 0.\nThe line $y=z$ goes from $(0,0)$ to $(1,1)$.\nIt must intersect each lobe. How many times?\nLet's consider the first lobe, on $[0, 1/8]$ (not exactly, but a subinterval).\n$\\Gamma(z)$ goes from 1 to 0. It must cross $y=z$ once.\nThen from 0 to 1. It must cross $y=z$ once.\nSo each pair of V-shapes (a \"crown\") will be crossed twice.\nThere are $2 \\times 2=4$ such crowns for $\\Gamma(z)$.\n$4 \\times 2 = 8$ solutions for $u_s$.\nSimilarly, for $v_s = H(|\\cos(3\\pi v_s)|)$, $|\\cos(3\\pi v_s)|$ has 3 lobes, so $3 \\times 4=12$ lobes for the function of $v_s$.\nThis gives $6 \\times 2 = 12$ solutions for $v_s$.\nFor each solution $u_{s,i}$ for $u_s$, we need to find the number of $x$ values.\n$u_{s,i} = H(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)$.\nFor each solution $v_{s,j}$ for $v_s$, we need to find the number of $y$ values.\n$v_{s,j} = H(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|)$.\nThe number of intersections is the product of the number of possible $x$ values and $y$ values.\nNumber of $x$ values is the number of solutions to $x = u_{s,i}$. There are 8 such values.\nNumber of $y$ values is the number of solutions to $y = v_{s,j}$. There are 12 such values.\nThe graphs are $x=u_{s,i}$ (vertical lines) and $y=v_{s,j}$ (horizontal lines).\nThe number of intersections is $8 \\times 12 = 96$.\n\nLet's check the fixed point counts.\n$z=H(|\\sin(2\\pi z)|)$. Let's check $z=0$. $0=H(0)=1$. No.\nLet's check $z=1$. $1=H(0)=1$. Yes. $z=1$ is a solution.\nThe lobes of $\\Gamma(z)$ are between the zeros of $H(|\\sin(2\\pi z)|)-1=0$.\n$|\\sin(2\\pi z)| \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$.\n$z \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$, $\\{1/12, 5/12, 7/12, 11/12\\}$, $\\{1/4, 3/4\\}$.\nThese are 9 points where $\\Gamma(z)=1$.\nThis divides $[0,1]$ into 8 intervals.\nIn each interval, $\\Gamma(z)$ goes from 1 to 0 and back to 1.\nThe line $y=z$ must cross this U-shape twice.\nSo $8 \\times 2 = 16$ solutions.\nLet's check the endpoints. $z=1$ is a solution.\nAt $z=0$, $\\Gamma(0)=1$. $y=z$ is at 0.\nAt $z=1$, $\\Gamma(1)=1$. $y=z$ is at 1. So they meet.\nLet's check the slope of $\\Gamma(z)$ at $z=1$.\n$\\Gamma'(z) = H'(|\\sin(2\\pi z)|) \\cdot \\mathrm{sgn}(\\sin(2\\pi z))\\cos(2\\pi z) \\cdot 2\\pi$.\nNear $z=1$, $\\sin(2\\pi z) \\approx -2\\pi(1-z)$, so it's negative.\n$|\\sin(2\\pi z)| \\approx 2\\pi(1-z)$. Let $w=2\\pi(1-z)$. $w \\to 0^+$.\n$H(w) \\approx H(0)=1$. $H'(w)$ near $w=0$ where $w>0$: $H(w)=4||w-1/2|-1/4|=4(1/2-w-1/4)=4(1/4-w)=1-4w$.\n$H'(w)=-4$.\n$\\Gamma'(1) = (-4) \\cdot (-1) \\cos(2\\pi) \\cdot 2\\pi = 8\\pi > 1$.\nSo $\\Gamma(z)$ crosses $y=z$ at $z=1$ from below.\nSince $\\Gamma(z_i)=1$ for $z_i=11/12$, and $11/12<1$, $\\Gamma(z)$ must come down to meet $y=z$ again.\nSo the last interval $[11/12, 1]$ has two solutions.\nThis holds for all 8 intervals. $8 \\times 2 = 16$ solutions.\nSo there are 16 values for $x$ and similarly $12 \\times 2 = 24$ values for $y$.\nTotal intersections: $16 \\times 24 = 384$.\n\nLet's re-evaluate $z=H(|\\sin(2\\pi z)|)$.\n$z \\in [0,1]$.\nNumber of solutions for $H(v)=c$ for $c \\in (0,1)$ is 4.\nNumber of solutions for $v=|\\sin(2\\pi z)|$ for $v \\in (0,1)$ is 4.\nLet $N_x$ be the number of solutions for $x$ and $N_y$ for $y$.\n$x = H(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|)$ and $y = H(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)$.\nLet's plot the graph of $y=H(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)$ and $x=H(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|)$.\nThe first graph is a sequence of $2 \\times 4 = 8$ crowns (half-lobe of sin is one crown). No, $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|$ is 2 lobes. $H$ is 2 crowns. $2 \\times 2=4$ crowns.\nThe graph of $y(x)$ is 4 crowns on $[0,1]$.\nThe graph of $x(y)$ is $3 \\times 2=6$ crowns on $[0,1]$.\nA crown for $y(x)$ is on $[0,1/4], [1/4,1/2], \\dots$.\nA crown for $x(y)$ is on $[0,1/6], [1/6,1/3], \\dots$.\nLet's consider the rectangle $[0,1/4]\\times[0,1/6]$.\nIn this box, $y(x)=H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ and $x(y)=H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$.\nLet $u=\\sin(2\\pi x)$ for $x \\in [0,1/4]$, $u \\in [0,1]$.\nLet $v=\\cos(3\\pi y)$ for $y \\in [0,1/6]$, $v \\in [0,1]$ (in reverse).\nSo we have $y=H(u)$ and $x=H(v)$.\nThis is one crown vs one (reversed) crown.\nLet's find intersections of $y=H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ and $x=H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$ in $[0,1/4]\\times[0,1/6]$.\nThis is equivalent to finding intersections of $y=H(u)$ and $x=H(1-v)$ where $u=\\sin(2\\pi x)$ and $v=1-\\cos(3\\pi y)$.\nThis is too complex.\n\nThe number of intersections of $y=f(x)$ and $x=g(y)$ is the number of intersections of $y=f(x)$ and $y=g^{-1}(x)$.\nThe function $x=H(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|)$ is not invertible.\nLet's count the number of monotonic sections.\n$y(x)$ has $2 \\times 4 \\times 2 = 16$ monotonic sections.\n$x(y)$ has $3 \\times 4 \\times 2 = 24$ monotonic sections.\nEach section of $y(x)$ can intersect at most one section of $x(y)$.\nThis gives a rough upper bound of $16 \\times 24 = 384$.\n\nLet's go back to the $(u,v)$ space, where $u=|\\sin(2\\pi x)|, v=|\\cos(3\\pi y)|$.\nThe number of solutions for $(u,v)$ from $u=\\Phi(v), v=\\Psi(u)$ was 193.\nThis seems way too high. Let's re-evaluate the intersection of $v=|\\cos(3\\pi u)|$ and $u=|\\sin(2\\pi v)|$.\nNumber of lobes of $|\\cos(3\\pi u)|$ is 3. Number of lobes of $|\\sin(2\\pi v)|$ is 2.\nEach lobe of the first function must intersect each lobe of the second.\nLet's take the first lobe of $v=|\\cos(3\\pi u)|$, for $u \\in [0,1/3]$. This is a U-shape from $(0,1)$ to $(1/3,1)$ through $(1/6,0)$.\nLet's take the first lobe of $u=|\\sin(2\\pi v)|$, for $v \\in [0,1/2]$. This is a C-shape from $(0,0)$ to $(0,1/2)$ through $(1,1/4)$.\nThe U-shape must cross the C-shape. From the drawing, it seems there are 2 intersections.\nThe second lobe of $u=|\\sin(2\\pi v)|$, for $v \\in [1/2,1]$, is a C-shape from $(0,1/2)$ to $(0,1)$ through $(1,3/4)$.\nThe U-shape from $(0,1)$ to $(1/3,1)$ must cross it. $(0,1)$ is an intersection point. It seems there is another one. So 2 intersections.\nSo the first lobe of $|\\cos(3\\pi u)|$ intersects the graph of $|\\sin(2\\pi v)|$ at $2+2=4$ points.\nThere are 3 such lobes for $|\\cos(3\\pi u)|$. Total $3 \\times 4 = 12$ interior intersections.\nPlus the boundary intersection at $(0,1)$. Total 13.\nThis confirms my first detailed analysis.\n$12 \\times 16 = 192$ interior $(u,v)$ solutions.\n$H(u)=0$ (2) and $H(v)=1$ (3) gives 6 boundary solutions.\nTotal 198 $(u,v)$ solutions.\n$192 \\times (4 \\times 6) = 4608$.\nThe 6 boundary solutions $(u,v)$ are $(1/4,0), (1/4,1/2), (1/4,1)$ and $(3/4,0), (3/4,1/2), (3/4,1)$.\n$u \\in \\{1/4,3/4\\}$. For each, 4 solutions for $x$.\n$v=0$: 3 solutions for $y$.\n$v=1/2$: 6 solutions for $y$.\n$v=1$: 4 solutions for $y$.\nNumber of solutions for $y$ for $v \\in \\{0,1/2,1\\}$ is $3+6+4=13$.\nFor each of the two $u$ values, we have 4 solutions for $x$.\nSo $2 \\times 4 \\times 13 = 104$.\nTotal is $4608+104=4712$.\n\nFinal check.\nNumber of solutions $(u',v')$ for $v'=|\\cos(3\\pi u')|$ and $u'=|\\sin(2\\pi v')|$ is 13.\nLet these solutions be $(u'_k, v'_k)$ for $k=1, \\dots, 13$.\nWe are solving $H(u)=u'_k$ and $H(v)=v'_k$.\nOne solution is $(u'_k,v'_k)=(0,1)$.\n$H(u)=0 \\implies u \\in \\{1/4,3/4\\}$. 2 solutions.\n$H(v)=1 \\implies v \\in \\{0,1/2,1\\}$. 3 solutions.\nThis gives $2 \\times 3 = 6$ pairs of $(u,v)$.\nThe other 12 solutions $(u'_k,v'_k)$ are in $(0,1)^2$.\nFor each such solution, $H(u)=u'_k$ has 4 solutions for $u$, and $H(v)=v'_k$ has 4 solutions for $v$.\nThis gives $12 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 192$ pairs of $(u,v)$.\nTotal number of $(u,v)$ pairs is $192+6=198$.\nFor each pair $(u,v)$, we count the number of $(x,y)$ solutions.\n$u=|\\sin(2\\pi x)|, v=|\\cos(3\\pi y)|$.\nThe 192 pairs are in $(0,1)^2$. So $192 \\times 4 \\times 6 = 4608$ solutions.\nThe 6 pairs are $(1/4,0), (1/4,1/2), (1/4,1), (3/4,0), (3/4,1/2), (3/4,1)$.\n$u=1/4$: 4 $x$-sols. $v=0$: 3 $y$-sols. $4 \\times 3=12$.\n$u=1/4$: 4 $x$-sols. $v=1/2$: 6 $y$-sols. $4 \\times 6=24$.\n$u=1/4$: 4 $x$-sols. $v=1$: 4 $y$-sols. $4 \\times 4=16$.\n$u=3/4$: 4 $x$-sols. $v=0$: 3 $y$-sols. $4 \\times 3=12$.\n$u=3/4$: 4 $x$-sols. $v=1/2$: 6 $y$-sols. $4 \\times 6=24$.\n$u=3/4$: 4 $x$-sols. $v=1$: 4 $y$-sols. $4 \\times 4=16$.\nSum is $12+24+16+12+24+16=104$.\nTotal is $4608+104=4712$.\nThe logic holds together.\n\n"

"Let the two given equations be\n(1) $y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))$\n(2) $x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))$\nwhere $f(t) = ||t|-\\frac{1}{2}|$ and $g(t) = ||t|-\\frac{1}{4}|$.\n\nLet's define the function $H(t) = 4g(f(t))$.\nLet $u=f(t) = ||t|-\\frac{1}{2}|$. Since the range of $f(t)$ is $[0, \\infty)$, we have $|u|=u$.\nSo $g(f(t)) = g(u) = |u-\\frac{1}{4}| = |||t|-\\frac{1}{2}|-\\frac{1}{4}|$.\nThus, $H(t) = 4|||t|-\\frac{1}{2}|-\\frac{1}{4}|$.\n\nThe arguments of the functions are $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ and $\\cos(3\\pi y)$, which are in the interval $[-1,1]$. Let $t \\in [-1,1]$. Then $|t| \\in [0,1]$. Let $v=|t|$.\n$H(t) = H(v) = 4||v-\\frac{1}{2}|-\\frac{1}{4}|$ for $v \\in [0,1]$.\nLet's analyze the shape of $H(v)$ for $v \\in [0,1]$.\n- $v-\\frac{1}{2}$ is a line from $-1/2$ to $1/2$.\n- $|v-\\frac{1}{2}|$ is a V-shape with minimum 0 at $v=1/2$ and maximum $1/2$ at $v=0,1$.\n- $|v-\\frac{1}{2}|-\\frac{1}{4}$ shifts the V-shape down by $1/4$. The range is $[-1/4, 1/4]$. The roots are at $v=1/4, 3/4$.\n- $||v-\\frac{1}{2}|-\\frac{1}{4}|$ reflects the negative part. This creates a W-shape with peaks at $v=0, 1/2, 1$ (value $1/4$) and minima at $v=1/4, 3/4$ (value 0).\n- $H(v) = 4||v-\\frac{1}{2}|-\\frac{1}{4}|$ scales this W-shape vertically by 4.\nThe graph of $H(v)$ for $v \\in [0,1]$ is a \"W\" with peaks of height 1 at $v=0, 1/2, 1$ and valleys of height 0 at $v=1/4, 3/4$.\n\nThe given system of equations is:\n(1) $y = Y(x) = H(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)$\n(2) $x = X(y) = H(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|)$\nFrom the definition of $H(v)$, the range of $Y(x)$ and $X(y)$ is $[0,1]$. So we are looking for solutions $(x,y)$ in the unit square $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$.\n\nLet's analyze the graphs of these two equations.\nThe graph of $y=Y(x)$:\nThe function $v(x) = |\\sin(2\\pi x)|$ is periodic with period $1/2$. In the interval $x \\in [0, 1/2]$, $v(x)$ goes from 0 to 1 (at $x=1/4$) and back to 0. This is one cycle for $v$.\nAs $v$ goes from 0 to 1, $H(v)$ draws a \"W\". As $v$ goes from 1 to 0, $H(v)$ draws a \"W\" in reverse. So for one cycle of $v(x)$, the graph of $Y(x)$ consists of two \"W\"-like shapes.\nSince $v(x)$ completes two cycles in $[0,1]$, the graph of $y=Y(x)$ consists of $2 \\times 2 = 4$ \"W\"-like shapes.\n\nThe graph of $x=X(y)$:\nThe function $w(y) = |\\cos(3\\pi y)|$ is periodic with period $1/3$. In the interval $y \\in [0,1]$, $w(y)$ completes 3 cycles.\nSimilarly, for each cycle of $w(y)$, the graph of $x=X(y)$ consists of two \"W\"-like shapes (oriented sideways).\nSo, the graph of $x=X(y)$ consists of $3 \\times 2 = 6$ sideways \"W\"-like shapes.\n\nTo find the number of intersections, we can count the intersections of \"arches\". An arch is a part of the curve between two consecutive zeros.\nThe zeros of $Y(x)$ occur when $H(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)=0$, which means $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|=1/4$ or $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|=3/4$.\nLet $v=|\\sin(2\\pi x)|$. In one cycle of $v$ (e.g., for $x \\in [0,1/2]$), $v$ goes from 0 to 1 and back to 0. The equation $v=c$ for $c \\in (0,1)$ has two solutions. So, in $[0,1/2]$, there are 2 solutions for $v=1/4$ and 2 for $v=3/4$. This gives 4 zeros for $Y(x)$ in $[0,1/2]$.\nIn the full interval $[0,1]$, there are $4 \\times 2 = 8$ zeros for $Y(x)$. Let them be $z_1 < z_2 < \\dots < z_8$.\nThese 8 zeros define 7 intervals $(z_i, z_{i+1})$ where $Y(x)>0$. In each such interval, the graph of $Y(x)$ is a single arch starting and ending at $y=0$, with a peak at $y=1$. This gives 7 full arches.\nAlso, $Y(0)=H(0)=1$ and $Y(1)=H(0)=1$. The graph segments on $[0,z_1)$ and $(z_8,1]$ are half-arches.\nSo, the graph of $y=Y(x)$ is composed of 8 full arches and 2 half-arches.\n\nThe zeros of $X(y)$ occur when $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|=1/4$ or $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|=3/4$.\nLet $w=|\\cos(3\\pi y)|$. In one cycle of $w$ (e.g., for $y \\in [0,1/3]$), $w$ goes from 1 to 0 and back to 1. The equation $w=c$ for $c \\in (0,1)$ has two solutions. So, in $[0,1/3]$, there are 2 solutions for $w=1/4$ and 2 for $w=3/4$. This gives 4 zeros for $X(y)$ in $[0,1/3]$.\nIn the full interval $[0,1]$, there are $4 \\times 3 = 12$ zeros for $X(y)$. Let them be $w_1 < w_2 < \\dots < w_{12}$.\nThe graph of $x=X(y)$ is composed of 11 full arches (for $y \\in (w_j, w_{j+1})$) and 2 half-arches (for $y \\in [0,w_1)$ and $(w_{12},1]$).\n\nLet's count the intersections by considering these arches.\n1.  Intersection of a full Y-arch and a full X-arch:\n    A full Y-arch, on an interval $(z_i, z_{i+1})$, is a $\\cup$-shaped curve from $(z_i,0)$ to $(z_{i+1},0)$ reaching a maximum $y=1$.\n    A full X-arch, on an interval $(w_j, w_{j+1})$, is a $\\supset$-shaped curve from $(0,w_j)$ to $(0,w_{j+1})$ reaching a maximum $x=1$.\n    A $\\cup$-shaped curve and a $\\supset$-shaped curve, with their endpoints on the boundaries of the unit square, must intersect in exactly two points.\n    There are 8 full Y-arches and 11 full X-arches. This gives $8 \\times 11 \\times 2 = 176$ intersections.\n\n2.  Intersection of a full Y-arch and a half X-arch:\n    A half X-arch is a monotonic curve. For instance, on $[0,w_1)$, the graph of $x=X(y)$ goes from $(1,0)$ to $(0,w_1)$.\n    A full Y-arch on $(z_i, z_{i+1})$ is contained in the vertical strip $x \\in (z_i, z_{i+1})$. The half X-arch spans $x \\in [0,1]$, so it must cross this strip. As the Y-arch is $\\cup$-shaped, the monotonic X-half-arch must intersect it twice.\n    There are 8 full Y-arches and 2 half X-arches. This gives $8 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 32$ intersections.\n\n3.  Intersection of a half Y-arch and a full X-arch:\n    By symmetry, a half Y-arch is a monotonic curve that must intersect a full $\\supset$-shaped X-arch twice.\n    There are 2 half Y-arches and 11 full X-arches. This gives $2 \\times 11 \\times 2 = 44$ intersections.\n\n4.  Intersection of a half Y-arch and a half X-arch:\n    There are 4 pairs of half-arches, corresponding to the four corners of the square.\n    -   $[0,z_1) \\times [0,w_1)$: $Y(x)$ goes from $(0,1)$ to $(z_1,0)$. $X(y)$ goes from $(1,0)$ to $(0,w_1)$. These two curves must intersect once.\n    -   $[0,z_1) \\times (w_{12},1]$: $Y(x)$ goes from $(0,1)$ to $(z_1,0)$. $X(y)$ goes from $(0,w_{12})$ to $(1,1)$. These must intersect once.\n    -   $(z_8,1] \\times [0,w_1)$: $Y(x)$ goes from $(z_8,0)$ to $(1,1)$. $X(y)$ goes from $(1,0)$ to $(0,w_1)$. These must intersect once.\n    -   $(z_8,1] \\times (w_{12},1]$: $Y(x)$ goes from $(z_8,0)$ to $(1,1)$. $X(y)$ goes from $(0,w_{12})$ to $(1,1)$. They intersect at the endpoint $(1,1)$. We need to check if they intersect elsewhere.\n        Near $x=1$, $y=Y(x) \\approx 1+8\\pi(x-1)$.\n        Near $y=1$, $x=X(y) \\approx 1-18\\pi^2(1-y)^2$.\n        The first curve has a finite slope $8\\pi$ at $(1,1)$. The second curve has a vertical tangent at $(1,1)$. They are not tangent and cross at $(1,1)$. A sketch shows they do not intersect elsewhere in that corner. So there is one intersection point.\n    This gives $1+1+1+1=4$ intersections.\n\nTotal number of intersections = $176 + 32 + 44 + 4 = 256$.\n\nLet's re-check the number of arches.\nZeros of $Y(x)$: $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|=1/4$ or $3/4$. In $[0,1]$, $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ takes each value $\\pm c$ twice for $c\\in(0,1)$. So $2\\times 2 + 2\\times 2 = 8$ zeros. Correct.\nZeros of $X(y)$: $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|=1/4$ or $3/4$. In $[0,1]$, $3\\pi y \\in [0,3\\pi]$. $\\cos(\\theta)=\\pm c$ has 6 solutions for $\\theta \\in [0,3\\pi]$ if $c \\in (0,1)$. So $6+6=12$ zeros. Correct.\nNumber of full Y-arches: $8-1=7$. No, there are 8 intervals between zeros if we don't count boundaries. Let's check. $z_1, ..., z_8$. Intervals are $(z_1,z_2), (z_2,z_3), ..., (z_7,z_8)$. That's 7.\nAh, the zeros are $z_{1/4,1}, z_{1/4,2}, z_{1/4,3}, z_{1/4,4}$ and $z_{3/4,1}, ...$.\nThe arches are between a $1/4$-zero and a $3/4$-zero.\nLet's look at $v=|\\sin(2\\pi x)|$. The zeros of $H(v)$ are $v=1/4, 3/4$. The peaks are $v=0,1/2,1$.\nThe sequence of critical values for $v$ in one cycle $x \\in [0,1/2]$ is $0 \\to 1/4 \\to 1/2 \\to 3/4 \\to 1 \\to 3/4 \\to 1/2 \\to 1/4 \\to 0$.\nThis corresponds to $Y(x)$ going $1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1$.\nThis sequence describes 4 arches. This happens over $x \\in [0,1/2]$. So in $[0,1]$, there are $4 \\times 2 = 8$ arches.\nThese are all full arches. $Y(0)=1, Y(1)=1$. So no half-arches in my previous sense. The graph starts and ends at a peak.\nNumber of Y-arches is 8.\nNumber of X-arches: $w=|\\cos(3\\pi y)|$ makes 3 cycles. Each cycle gives 4 arches. So $3 \\times 4 = 12$ arches.\nEach Y-arch and each X-arch must intersect twice.\nTotal intersections = $8 \\times 12 \\times 2 = 192$.\nLet's verify the arch intersection argument.\nA Y-arch is on $(x_1,x_2)$ where $Y(x_1)=Y(x_2)=0$. It's a $\\cup$-shape.\nAn X-arch is on $(y_1,y_2)$ where $X(y_1)=X(y_2)=0$. It's a $\\supset$-shape.\nThe peak of the Y-arch is $(x_p,1)$. The span of the X-arch is $[0,1]\\times[y_1,y_2]$. The peak is within the y-span of the X-arch.\nThe peak of the X-arch is $(1,y_p)$. The span of the Y-arch is $[x_1,x_2]\\times[0,1]$. The peak is within the x-span of the Y-arch.\nThis guarantees two intersections.\nThe number of Y-arches is indeed 8. The zeros are at $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|=1/4,3/4$. Between any two consecutive zeros, there is a peak where $|\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\in \\{0,1/2,1\\}$.\nThe peaks of $Y(x)$ are at $x \\in \\{0, 1/12, 1/4, 5/12, 1/2, 7/12, 3/4, 11/12, 1\\}$.\nThe zeros of $Y(x)$ are at 8 intermediate points.\nThis gives 8 arches.\nThe peaks of $X(y)$ are at $y \\in \\{0, 1/9, 1/6, 2/9, 1/3, 4/9, 1/2, 5/9, 2/3, 7/9, 5/6, 8/9, 1\\}$.\nThe zeros of $X(y)$ are at 12 intermediate points.\nThis gives 12 arches.\nThe total number of intersections is $8 \\times 12 \\times 2 = 192$.\n\nFinal check:\n$y=Y(x)$ has 8 arches. $x=X(y)$ has 12 arches.\nLet $A_i$ be the $i$-th arch for $Y(x)$, $i=1,\\dots,8$.\nLet $B_j$ be the $j$-th arch for $X(y)$, $j=1,\\dots,12$.\nAn arch $A_i$ is the graph of $Y(x)$ on $[z_i, z_{i+1}]$ where $Y(z_i)=Y(z_{i+1})=0$.\nAn arch $B_j$ is the graph of $X(y)$ on $[w_j, w_{j+1}]$ where $X(w_j)=X(w_{j+1})=0$.\nThe graph of $A_i$ is a simple curve from $(z_i,0)$ to $(z_{i+1},0)$ through a point $(x_p,1)$.\nThe graph of $B_j$ is a simple curve from $(0,w_j)$ to $(0,w_{j+1})$ through a point $(1,y_p)$.\nThe rectangle $[z_i,z_{i+1}]\\times[w_j,w_{j+1}]$ contains portions of both curves.\nThe curve $A_i$ enters this rectangle from the bottom edge, goes up to $y=1$ (which is above the rectangle's top edge $y=w_{j+1}$), and comes back down, exiting from the bottom edge.\nThe curve $B_j$ enters from the left edge, goes right to $x=1$ (which is outside the rectangle's right edge $x=z_{i+1}$), and comes back, exiting from the left edge.\nThe part of $A_i$ inside the horizontal strip $\\mathbb{R}\\times[w_j,w_{j+1}]$ consists of two disjoint segments.\nThe part of $B_j$ inside the vertical strip $[z_i,z_{i+1}]\\times\\mathbb{R}$ consists of two disjoint segments.\nThis is not as simple.\nThe previous argument is better. The U-shape curve and C-shape curve.\nThe U-shape is $y=Y(x)$ for $x \\in [z_i, z_{i+1}]$.\nThe C-shape is $x=X(y)$ for $y \\in [w_j, w_{j+1}]$.\nThe U-shape is contained in $[z_i, z_{i+1}] \\times [0,1]$.\nThe C-shape is contained in $[0,1] \\times [w_j, w_{j+1}]$.\nThe peak of the U-shape $(x_p,1)$ is above the C-shape's y-range $[w_j, w_{j+1}]$.\nThe peak of the C-shape $(1,y_p)$ is to the right of the U-shape's x-range $[z_i, z_{i+1}]$.\nThe endpoints of the U-shape, $(z_i,0)$ and $(z_{i+1},0)$, are below the C-shape's y-range.\nThe endpoints of the C-shape, $(0,w_j)$ and $(0,w_{j+1})$, are to the left of the U-shape's x-range.\nThis guarantees that the two curves must cross exactly twice. The argument holds.\n\nFinal answer is $8 \\times 12 \\times 2 = 192$.\n\nFinal check on number of arches.\n$Y(x)$ has 8 zeros in $(0,1)$. $Y(0)=1, Y(1)=1$.\nThe graph of $Y(x)$ is composed of 8 arches and connects $(0,1)$ to $(1,1)$.\n$X(y)$ has 12 zeros in $(0,1)$. $X(0)=1, X(1)=1$.\nThe graph of $X(y)$ is composed of 12 arches and connects $(1,0)$ to $(1,1)$. No, $X(0)=1$, so from $(1,0)$. $X(1)=1$, so to $(1,1)$.\nThe number of intersections is $8 \\times 12 \\times 2 = 192$.\n\n"

"Let the two given equations be\n(1) $y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))$\n(2) $x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))$\n\nThe functions are defined as $f(t) = ||t|-\\frac{1}{2}|$ and $g(t) = ||t|-\\frac{1}{4}|$.\nLet's define a composite function $H(t) = 4g(f(t))$.\nFor any $t$, $f(t) \\ge 0$, so $g(f(t)) = |f(t) - \\frac{1}{4}|$.\n$H(t) = 4|f(t) - \\frac{1}{4}| = 4|||t|-\\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4}|$.\n\nThe equations become:\n(1) $y = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$\n(2) $x = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$\n\nThe arguments of the sine and cosine functions suggest that the interesting domain for $x$ and $y$ is $[0,1]$.\nLet's analyze the range of $H(t)$ for $t \\in [-1,1]$.\nLet $v = |t|$, so $v \\in [0,1]$.\n$H(t) = 4||v-\\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4}|$.\n- If $v=0$, $H(t) = 4||\\frac{1}{2}|-\\frac{1}{4}| = 4|\\frac{1}{4}| = 1$.\n- If $v=1/4$, $H(t) = 4||\\frac{1}{4}|-\\frac{1}{4}| = 0$.\n- If $v=1/2$, $H(t) = 4||0|-\\frac{1}{4}| = 1$.\n- If $v=3/4$, $H(t) = 4||\\frac{1}{4}|-\\frac{1}{4}| = 0$.\n- If $v=1$, $H(t) = 4||\\frac{1}{2}|-\\frac{1}{4}| = 1$.\nThe range of $H(t)$ for $t \\in [-1,1]$ is $[0,1]$.\nFrom (1), $y \\in [0,1]$. From (2), $x \\in [0,1]$. We search for solutions in the unit square $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$.\n\nTo find the number of intersections, we can find the number of solutions to the system of equations.\nLet's substitute (1) into (2):\n$x = H(\\cos(3\\pi y)) = H(\\cos(3\\pi H(\\sin(2\\pi x))))$.\nThis is a fixed-point problem $x = G(x)$ where $G(x) = H(\\cos(3\\pi H(\\sin(2\\pi x))))$.\n\nTo simplify the analysis, let $u = 2\\pi x$. As $x$ spans $[0,1]$, $u$ spans $[0, 2\\pi]$.\nThe equation becomes $\\frac{u}{2\\pi} = H(\\cos(3\\pi H(\\sin u)))$.\nLet $F(u) = 2\\pi H(\\cos(3\\pi H(\\sin u)))$. We are looking for the number of solutions to $u = F(u)$ for $u \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\nEach solution $u \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ corresponds to a unique $x \\in [0,1)$, and thus to a unique intersection point. The solution $u=2\\pi$ corresponds to $x=1$.\n\nLet's analyze the function $F(u)$ by breaking it down.\nLet $h_1(u) = H(\\sin u)$. The function $H(t)$ is even, so $H(\\sin u) = H(-\\sin u) = H(\\sin(\\pi+u))$. Also $H(\\sin u) = H(\\sin(\\pi-u))$.\nThe function $H(t)$ has a \"multi-W\" shape. For $t \\in [-1,1]$, it has peaks at $t \\in \\{-1, -1/2, 0, 1/2, 1\\}$ (value 1) and roots at $t \\in \\{-3/4, -1/4, 1/4, 3/4\\}$ (value 0).\nThe function $h_1(u)=H(\\sin u)$ is periodic with period $\\pi$.\nAs $u$ goes from $0$ to $\\pi$, $\\sin u$ goes from $0$ to $1$ and back to $0$.\nThe graph of $H(t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ is a W-shape with two full bumps. So $h_1(u)$ on $[0,\\pi]$ consists of 4 bumps (it traces the W-shape and then backwards). On $[0, 2\\pi]$, $h_1(u)$ consists of 8 bumps, oscillating between 0 and 1.\n\nLet $h_2(v) = H(\\cos v)$. This function is periodic with period $\\pi$.\nAs $v$ goes from $0$ to $\\pi$, $\\cos v$ goes from $1$ to $-1$. The graph of $H(t)$ for $t \\in [-1,1]$ has 4 full bumps. So $h_2(v)$ on $[0,\\pi]$ consists of 4 bumps. On $[0, 3\\pi]$, $h_2(v)$ consists of $3 \\times 4 = 12$ bumps, oscillating between 0 and 1.\n\nOur function is $F(u) = 2\\pi h_2(3\\pi h_1(u))$.\nLet's count the number of \"bumps\" in $F(u)$ on $[0, 2\\pi]$.\nThe number of monotonic sections of $H(t)$ for $t \\in [-1,1]$ is 8 (between its critical points $0, \\pm 1/4, \\pm 1/2, \\pm 3/4, \\pm 1$).\n1. The function $\\sin u$ on $[0, 2\\pi]$ has 4 monotonic sections. The preimages of the critical points of $H(t)$ under $\\sin u$ define $4 \\times 4 = 16$ intervals on which $h_1(u) = H(\\sin u)$ is monotonic.\nLet these interval-defining points be $0=u_0 < u_1 < \\dots < u_{16}=2\\pi$.\nOn each interval $[u_k, u_{k+1}]$, $h_1(u)$ is monotonic and its range is $[0,1]$ or $[1,0]$.\n2. Let $v = 3\\pi h_1(u)$. On each such interval, $v$ sweeps monotonically over $[0, 3\\pi]$ or $[3\\pi, 0]$.\n3. The function $h_2(v) = H(\\cos v)$ has $3 \\times 8 = 24$ monotonic sections on $[0, 3\\pi]$.\n4. The composite function $F(u)/(2\\pi) = h_2(v) = h_2(3\\pi h_1(u))$ will thus have $16 \\times 24 = 384$ monotonic sections on $[0, 2\\pi]$.\nThis means $F(u)$ has $384/2 = 192$ bumps on $[0, 2\\pi]$.\n\nLet's determine the values of $F(u)$ at the endpoints of these bumps.\nA bump is a segment of the graph going from a maximum to a minimum and back to a maximum, or vice versa.\nThe maxima of $H$ are 1, minima are 0. So the maxima of $F(u)$ are $2\\pi$ and minima are $0$.\nThe bumps of $F(u)$ are separated by points where its value is either $0$ or $2\\pi$.\nLet's check the values of $F(u)$ at the points $u_k$.\nAt these points, $\\sin u_k$ is one of $\\{0, \\pm 1/4, \\pm 1/2, \\pm 3/4, \\pm 1\\}$.\nIf $\\sin u_k \\in \\{\\pm 1/4, \\pm 3/4\\}$, then $h_1(u_k)=H(\\sin u_k)=0$.\nThen $v = 3\\pi \\cdot 0 = 0$. $F(u_k) = 2\\pi H(\\cos 0) = 2\\pi H(1) = 2\\pi$.\nIf $\\sin u_k \\in \\{0, \\pm 1/2, \\pm 1\\}$, then $h_1(u_k)=H(\\sin u_k)=1$.\nThen $v = 3\\pi \\cdot 1 = 3\\pi$. $F(u_k) = 2\\pi H(\\cos 3\\pi) = 2\\pi H(-1) = 2\\pi$.\nSo, at all points $u_k$ for $k=0, \\dots, 16$, we have $F(u_k)=2\\pi$.\nThis means that on each of the 16 intervals $[u_k, u_{k+1}]$, the function $F(u)$ starts at $2\\pi$, creates a number of bumps, and ends at $2\\pi$.\nThe minima of the bumps must be 0.\nLet's find the number of bumps in one such interval, say $[u_k, u_{k+1}]$.\nOn this interval, $v=3\\pi h_1(u)$ goes from $0$ to $3\\pi$ (or $3\\pi$ to $0$).\nAs $v$ sweeps $[0, 3\\pi]$, $h_2(v)=H(\\cos v)$ performs 12 bumps (4 for each length of $\\pi$).\nSo, on each of the 16 intervals $[u_k, u_{k+1}]$, $F(u)$ performs 12 bumps.\nThe total number of bumps of $F(u)$ on $[0, 2\\pi]$ is $16 \\times 12 = 192$.\nEach of these 192 bumps is a section of the graph that goes from $y=2\\pi$ down to $y=0$ and back up to $y=2\\pi$.\n\nWe want to find the number of solutions to $u=F(u)$. Let's analyze the intersections of $y=F(u)$ and $y=u$.\nThe line $y=u$ goes from $(0,0)$ to $(2\\pi, 2\\pi)$.\nThe graph of $y=F(u)$ starts at $(0, F(0))=(0, 2\\pi)$ and ends at $(2\\pi, F(2\\pi))=(2\\pi, 2\\pi)$.\nThe point $u=2\\pi$ is a solution. This corresponds to the intersection point $(x,y)=(1,1)$.\nLet's consider a single bump on an interval $[a,b]$, where $F(a)=F(b)=2\\pi$ and for some $c \\in (a,b)$, $F(c)=0$.\nWe are looking for roots of $k(u) = F(u)-u$.\n$k(a) = F(a)-a = 2\\pi-a$.\n$k(b) = F(b)-b = 2\\pi-b$.\n$k(c) = F(c)-c = -c$.\nSince $a,b,c \\in [0, 2\\pi]$, we have $k(c) = -c \\le 0$. Equality holds only if $c=0$, but $F(0)=2\\pi \\ne 0$. So $k(c)<0$.\nFor any bump not ending at $u=2\\pi$, we have $a,b < 2\\pi$, so $k(a)>0$ and $k(b)>0$.\nBy the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is a root in $(a,c)$ and another root in $(c,b)$. So each such bump gives 2 solutions.\nThe number of bumps is 192. The last bump ends at $u=2\\pi$.\nLet's count the number of solutions.\nThere are 191 bumps that are entirely contained in $[0, 2\\pi)$.\nEach of these gives 2 solutions. $191 \\times 2 = 382$ solutions.\nThe last bump starts at some $a < 2\\pi$ and ends at $b=2\\pi$.\n$k(a) = 2\\pi-a > 0$.\n$k(2\\pi) = F(2\\pi)-2\\pi = 0$. So $u=2\\pi$ is a solution.\nAt the minimum $c$ of this last bump, $k(c) = -c < 0$.\nSo there is one solution in $(a,c)$ and the solution at $u=2\\pi$. That's 2 solutions for the last bump as well.\nSo all 192 bumps provide 2 solutions each.\nTotal number of solutions is $192 \\times 2 = 384$.\n\nEach solution $u \\in [0, 2\\pi]$ corresponds to a unique value $x = u/(2\\pi) \\in [0,1]$.\nFor each such $x$, $y$ is uniquely determined as $y=H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$.\nThis $(x,y)$ pair is an intersection point.\nDifferent values of $u$ give different values of $x$, so they correspond to distinct intersection points.\nThe total number of intersections is the number of solutions for $u$.\n\nFinal count: $16 \\times 12 \\times 2 = 384$.\n\n"

"Let the two given equations be\n(1) $y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))$\n(2) $x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))$\n\nFirst, let's analyze the function composition. Let $H(t) = 4g(f(t))$.\nThe definitions of $f(t)$ and $g(t)$ are $f(t) = ||t|-\\frac{1}{2}|$ and $g(t) = ||t|-\\frac{1}{4}|$.\nSo, $H(t) = 4|||t|-\\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4}|$.\n\nThe arguments of the trigonometric functions are $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ and $\\cos(3\\pi y)$. Let $u = \\sin(2\\pi x)$ and $v = \\cos(3\\pi y)$. The range of both $u$ and $v$ is $[-1, 1]$.\nThe equations become $y = H(u)$ and $x = H(v)$.\nThe range of $H(t)$ for $t \\in [-1,1]$ determines the possible values of $x$ and $y$.\nFor $t \\in [-1,1]$, $|t| \\in [0,1]$.\n$|t|-\\frac{1}{2} \\in [-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}]$.\n$||t|-\\frac{1}{2}| \\in [0, \\frac{1}{2}]$.\n$||t|-\\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4} \\in [-\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{4}]$.\n$| ||t|-\\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4} | \\in [0, \\frac{1}{4}]$.\n$H(t) = 4| ||t|-\\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4} | \\in [0, 1]$.\nSo, we must have $x \\in [0,1]$ and $y \\in [0,1]$. We are looking for the number of intersections of the two graphs in the unit square $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$.\n\nLet's analyze the graph of $H(t)$ for $t \\in [-1,1]$.\n$H(t)$ is an even function, since it depends only on $|t|$. So $H(t)=H(-t)$.\nLet's study $H(t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$. Here $|t|=t$.\n$H(t) = 4||t-\\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4}|$ for $t \\in [0,1]$.\n- If $t \\in [0, 1/2]$, $H(t) = 4|(\\frac{1}{2}-t) - \\frac{1}{4}| = 4|\\frac{1}{4}-t|$. This is a V-shape with a minimum at $t=1/4$.\n$H(0)=1$, $H(1/4)=0$, $H(1/2)=1$.\n- If $t \\in [1/2, 1]$, $H(t) = 4|(t-\\frac{1}{2}) - \\frac{1}{4}| = 4|t-\\frac{3}{4}|$. This is a V-shape with a minimum at $t=3/4$.\n$H(1/2)=1$, $H(3/4)=0$, $H(1)=1$.\nFor $t \\in [0,1]$, the graph of $H(t)$ looks like a \"W\". It starts at $(0,1)$, goes down to $(1/4,0)$, up to $(1/2,1)$, down to $(3/4,0)$, and up to $(1,1)$.\nSince $H(t)$ is even, the graph for $t \\in [-1,0]$ is a mirror image. This results in a \"double-W\" shape for $t \\in [-1,1]$.\n\nThe first equation is $y = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ for $x \\in [0,1]$.\nAs $x$ goes from $0$ to $1$, $u=\\sin(2\\pi x)$ completes one cycle from $0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to -1 \\to 0$.\n- $x \\in [0, 1/4]$: $u$ goes from $0$ to $1$. $y(x)$ traces one full W-shape.\n- $x \\in [1/4, 1/2]$: $u$ goes from $1$ to $0$. $y(x)$ traces the same W-shape in reverse.\n- $x \\in [1/2, 3/4]$: $u$ goes from $0$ to $-1$. Since $H$ is even, $y(x)$ traces another W-shape.\n- $x \\in [3/4, 1]$: $u$ goes from $-1$ to $0$. $y(x)$ traces the W-shape in reverse.\nSo, the graph of $y(x)$ for $x \\in [0,1]$ is a sequence of 4 W-shapes.\n\nThe second equation is $x = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$ for $y \\in [0,1]$.\nAs $y$ goes from $0$ to $1$, $v=\\cos(3\\pi y)$ goes from $1 \\to -1 \\to 1 \\to -1$, which is $1.5$ cycles.\n- $y \\in [0, 1/3]$: $v$ goes from $1$ to $-1$. $y \\in [0,1/6]$, $v:1\\to 0$; $y \\in [1/6,1/3]$, $v:0\\to-1$. This corresponds to two W-shapes for $x(y)$ (one reversed, one direct, as $H$ is even).\n- $y \\in [1/3, 2/3]$: $v$ goes from $-1$ to $1$. This gives two more W-shapes.\n- $y \\in [2/3, 1]$: $v$ goes from $1$ to $-1$. This gives two more W-shapes.\nSo, the graph of $x(y)$ for $y \\in [0,1]$ is a sequence of 6 sideways W-shapes.\n\nTo find the number of intersections, we can divide the unit square $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$ into a grid of smaller rectangular cells. The boundaries of these cells are defined by the values of $x$ and $y$ where the arguments of $H$ are integers or half-integers.\nThe graph of $y(x)$ consists of 4 W-shapes in the intervals $[0,1/4], [1/4,1/2], [1/2,3/4], [3/4,1]$.\nThe graph of $x(y)$ consists of 6 W-shapes in the intervals $[0,1/6], [1/6,1/3], [1/3,1/2], [1/2,2/3], [2/3,5/6], [5/6,1]$.\nThis partitions the unit square into a $4 \\times 6$ grid of 24 cells.\n\nLet's analyze the number of intersections within one such cell, for instance $I_1 \\times J_1 = [0,1/4] \\times [0,1/6]$.\nIn this cell, as $x$ increases from $0$ to $1/4$, $u=\\sin(2\\pi x)$ increases from $0$ to $1$. The graph of $y(x)$ is a W-shape connecting the points $(0,1)$ and $(1/4,1)$.\nAs $y$ increases from $0$ to $1/6$, $v=\\cos(3\\pi y)$ decreases from $1$ to $0$. The graph of $x(y)$ is a sideways W-shape (traced in reverse) connecting $(1,0)$ and $(1,1/6)$.\n\nLet's analyze the number of intersections of a W-curve and a sideways W-curve in a rectangle.\nA W-curve, say $C_y$, consists of 4 monotonic branches. For $y(x)$ in $[0,1/4]$, the branches connect $(0,1) \\to (x_1,0) \\to (1/12,1) \\to (x_2,0) \\to (1/4,1)$.\nA sideways W-curve, say $C_x$, also has 4 monotonic branches. For $x(y)$ in $[0,1/6]$, the branches connect $(1,0) \\to (0,y_1) \\to (1,y_2) \\to (0,y_3) \\to (1,1/6)$.\n\nLet's denote the four branches of $C_y$ as $\\gamma_1, \\gamma_2, \\gamma_3, \\gamma_4$ and those of $C_x$ as $\\delta_1, \\delta_2, \\delta_3, \\delta_4$.\n- $\\gamma_1$ goes from the top edge to the bottom edge of the cell. $\\delta_1$ goes from the right edge to the left edge. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, these two curves must intersect.\n- $\\gamma_2$ goes from bottom to top. $\\delta_2$ goes from left to right. They must intersect.\n- $\\gamma_3$ goes from top to bottom. $\\delta_3$ goes from right to left. They must intersect.\n- $\\gamma_4$ goes from bottom to top. $\\delta_4$ goes from left to right. They must intersect.\n\nThis gives at least 4 intersection points. A more detailed analysis shows that each branch of the W-curve intersects exactly one branch of the sideways W-curve. For example, $\\gamma_1$ (monotonically decreasing) cannot intersect $\\delta_2$ (monotonically increasing in both $x$ and $y$) more than once. It is also unlikely to intersect $\\delta_3$ or $\\delta_4$.\nSo, we can conclude that there are exactly 4 intersections inside each of the $4 \\times 6 = 24$ cells.\n\nThe intersections are all strictly inside the cells, unless they lie on the boundaries of the cells.\nLet's check for intersections on the grid lines, e.g., $x=1/4$.\nFor a point on $C_1$, if $x=1/4$, $y = H(\\sin(\\pi/2)) = H(1) = 1$. So we have the point $(1/4, 1)$.\nFor a point on $C_2$ to be on the line $x=1/4$, we need $1/4 = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$.\nThis means the point $(1/4,y)$ is on $C_2$.\nThe point $(1/4,1)$ would be an intersection if it lies on both curves. It is on $C_1$. Is it on $C_2$?\nFor $(1/4,1)$ to be on $C_2$, we need $1/4 = H(\\cos(3\\pi \\cdot 1)) = H(-1) = 1$, which is false.\nSo there are no intersections on the interior grid line $x=1/4$. The same logic applies to $x=1/2, 3/4$ and $y=j/6$ for $j=1,...,5$. All these grid lines are mapped to $x=1$ or $y=1$, and none of these lead to an intersection.\n\nThe only possible exception is the boundary of the entire square $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$.\n- $x=0$: $y(0)=1$. $C_2$ has points on $x=0$ where $H(\\cos(3\\pi y))=0$, which gives 12 values for $y$. None of these is $y=1$.\n- $x=1$: $y(1)=1$. $C_2$ has points on $x=1$ where $H(\\cos(3\\pi y))=1$, which gives 13 values for $y$, one of which is $y=1$. So $(1,1)$ is an intersection.\n- $y=0$: $x(0)=1$. $C_1$ has points on $y=0$ where $H(\\sin(2\\pi x))=0$, giving 8 values for $x$. None is $x=1$.\n- $y=1$: $x(1)=1$. $C_1$ has points on $y=1$ where $H(\\sin(2\\pi x))=1$, giving 9 values for $x$, one of which is $x=1$. So $(1,1)$ is an intersection.\n\nThe point $(1,1)$ is an intersection point. This point lies on the boundary of the cell $[3/4,1]\\times[5/6,1]$.\nOur count of 4 intersections per cell is based on a topological argument that the curves enter and exit on opposite sides. Let's check the cell $[3/4,1]\\times[5/6,1]$.\n$y(x)$ connects $(3/4,1)$ to $(1,1)$.\n$x(y)$ connects $(1,5/6)$ to $(1,1)$.\nThe two curves meet at the corner $(1,1)$.\nLet's analyze the curves near $(1,1)$. Let $x=1-\\epsilon, y=1-\\delta$ for small $\\epsilon, \\delta > 0$.\n$y(1-\\epsilon) = H(\\sin(2\\pi(1-\\epsilon))) = H(-\\sin(2\\pi\\epsilon)) = H(\\sin(2\\pi\\epsilon)) \\approx H(2\\pi\\epsilon) \\approx 1-4(2\\pi\\epsilon) = 1-8\\pi\\epsilon$.\nSo $1-\\delta \\approx 1-8\\pi\\epsilon \\implies \\delta \\approx 8\\pi\\epsilon$.\n$x(1-\\delta) = H(\\cos(3\\pi(1-\\delta))) = H(-\\cos(3\\pi\\delta)) = H(\\cos(3\\pi\\delta)) \\approx H(1-(3\\pi\\delta)^2/2) \\approx 1-4(1-(1-(3\\pi\\delta)^2/2)) = 1-2(3\\pi\\delta)^2 = 1-18\\pi^2\\delta^2$.\nSo $1-\\epsilon \\approx 1-18\\pi^2\\delta^2 \\implies \\epsilon \\approx 18\\pi^2\\delta^2$.\nSubstituting $\\delta \\approx 8\\pi\\epsilon$ into the second equation gives $\\epsilon \\approx 18\\pi^2(8\\pi\\epsilon)^2 = 18 \\cdot 64 \\pi^4 \\epsilon^2$.\nSince $\\epsilon \\ne 0$, we have $1 \\approx 1152\\pi^4 \\epsilon$, so $\\epsilon \\approx 1/(1152\\pi^4)$, which is a small positive value. This corresponds to one intersection point near $(1,1)$ but within the interior of the cell.\nThe point $(1,1)$ is a second intersection point.\nA careful sketch would show that the last branches of the W-shapes, which meet at $(1,1)$, must cross once more inside the cell. The other three pairs of branches produce one intersection each as reasoned before. So there are still 4 intersections in this corner cell, with one of them being exactly at the corner $(1,1)$.\n\nSince the point $(1,1)$ is on the boundary of only one cell in our grid, no overcounting occurs.\nTotal number of intersections = (Number of cells) $\\times$ (Intersections per cell)\nTotal = $24 \\times 4 = 96$.\n\n"

So $t \\in \\{\\pm 1/4, \\pm 3/4\\}$.\nThe function $H(t)$ reaches its maximum value of 1 when the argument of the outer absolute value is $\\pm 1/4$.\nThis happens when $||t|-\\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4} = \\pm 1/4$.\n$||t|-\\frac{1}{2}| = 0$ or $1/2$.\n$|t|-\\frac{1}{2} = 0 \\implies |t|=1/2$.\n$|t|-\\frac{1}{2} = \\pm 1/2 \\implies |t|=1$ or $|t|=0$.\nSo $H(t)=1$ for $t \\in \\{0, \\pm 1/2, \\pm 1\\}$.\n\nAn \"arch\" of the graph of $C_1$ is a segment of the curve between two consecutive roots of $y=H(\\sin(2\\pi x))=0$.\nThe roots occur when $\\sin(2\\pi x) \\in \\{\\pm 1/4, \\pm 3/4\\}$.\nLet's trace $t = \\sin(2\\pi x)$ as $x$ goes from 0 to 1.

(1 arch)\nSo, the graph of $C_1$ has 4 arches, let's call them $A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4$.\n\nSimilarly for $C_2: x = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$, we trace $t' = \\cos(3\\pi y)$ as $y$ goes from 0 to 1. The path of $t'$ is $1 \\to -1 \\to 1 \\to -1$.\n1. $y \\in [0, 1/3]$: $t'$ goes from 1 to -1. It crosses $3/4, 1/4, -1/4, -3/4$. This gives two arches. (2 arches)\n2. $y \\in [1/3, 2/3]$: $t'$ goes from -1 to 1. It crosses $-3/4, -1/4, 1/4, 3/4$. (2 arches)\n3. $y \\in [2/3, 1]$: $t'$ goes from 1 to -1. It crosses $3/4, 1/4, -1/4, -3/4$. (2 arches)\nSo, the graph of $C_2$ has 6 arches, let's call them $B_1, \\dots, B_6$.\n\nLet's find the number of intersections of an arch $A_i$ and an arch $B_j$.\nAn arch $A_i$ is the graph of $y=H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ for $x$ in some interval $I_i \\subset (0,1)$. On this interval, $y$ starts at 0, reaches a maximum of 1, and returns to 0.\nAn arch $B_j$ is the graph of $x=H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$ for $y$ in some interval $J_j \\subset (0,1)$. On this interval, $x$ starts at 0, reaches a maximum of 1, and returns to 0.\n\nLet's analyze one such intersection. For an arch $A_i$, we can describe $x$ as a function of $y$. The arch is not monotonic, so for a given $y \\in (0,1)$, there are two corresponding $x$ values. Let's call them $x_{i,L}(y)$ (left branch) and $x_{i,R}(y)$ (right branch). $x_{i,L}(y)$ is an increasing function of $y$ (for $y \\in (0,1)$), and $x_{i,R}(y)$ is a decreasing function of $y$.\nSimilarly, for an arch $B_j$, for a given $x \\in (0,1)$, there are two $y$ values, $y_{j,U}(x)$ and $y_{j,L}(x)$.\n\nLet's consider the intersection of $A_i$ and $B_j$ from the perspective of the variable $y \\in J_j$.\nWe are looking for solutions to $x_{i,L}(y) = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$ and $x_{i,R}(y) = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$ for $y \\in J_j$.\nLet's analyze the first equation: $x_{i,L}(y) = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$.\nLet $h_L(y) = H(\\cos(3\\pi y)) - x_{i,L}(y)$.\nThe interval $J_j$ is of the form $(s_1, s_2)$ where $H(\\cos(3\\pi s_1))=H(\\cos(3\\pi s_2))=0$.\nAt the endpoints of the interval $J_j$, $y=s_1, s_2$, we have $H(\\cos(3\\pi y))=0$.\nThe value $x_{i,L}(s_1)$ is some value $x_1 \\in I_i$, so $x_1>0$.\nThus, $h_L(s_1) = 0 - x_{i,L}(s_1) < 0$. Similarly, $h_L(s_2) < 0$.\nInside $J_j$, there is a value $y_m$ where the arch $B_j$ reaches its maximum, so $H(\\cos(3\\pi y_m))=1$.\nAt this point, $h_L(y_m) = 1 - x_{i,L}(y_m)$.\nThe value $x_{i,L}(y_m)$ is the $x$-coordinate on the left branch of arch $A_i$ corresponding to $y=y_m$. Since all $x$ values on arch $A_i$ are in $(0,1)$, we have $0 < x_{i,L}(y_m) < 1$.\nTherefore, $h_L(y_m) = 1 - x_{i,L}(y_m) > 0$.\nSince $h_L(s_1)<0$ and $h_L(y_m)>0$, there must be at least one root in $(s_1, y_m)$.\nSince $h_L(y_m)>0$ and $h_L(s_2)<0$, there must be at least one root in $(y_m, s_2)$.\nThe function $x_{i,L}(y)$ is monotonic on $(0,1)$, while $H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$ on $J_j$ first increases from 0 to 1, then decreases from 1 to 0. A simple shape analysis shows there is exactly one root in $(s_1, y_m)$ and exactly one in $(y_m, s_2)$. So there are 2 intersections for the left branch of $A_i$.\n\nNow consider the right branch of $A_i$, $x_{i,R}(y)$. Let $h_R(y) = H(\\cos(3\\pi y)) - x_{i,R}(y)$.\nSimilarly, $h_R(s_1) < 0$ and $h_R(s_2) < 0$.\nAt $y=y_m$, $h_R(y_m) = 1 - x_{i,R}(y_m)$. Since $0 < x_{i,R}(y_m) < 1$, we have $h_R(y_m) > 0$.\nThis implies that there are also 2 intersection points for the right branch of $A_i$ with the arch $B_j$.\nIn total, any arch $A_i$ intersects any arch $B_j$ in exactly 4 points.\n\nSince there are 4 arches for $C_1$ and 6 arches for $C_2$, the total number of intersections between all arches is $4 \\times 6 \\times 4 = 96$.\nThese intersections occur for $x,y \\in (0,1)$, because the arches are defined on open subintervals of $(0,1)$.\n\nWe should also check for solutions on the boundary of the square $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$.\nLet's check the corners:\n- $(0,0)$: $y(0)=H(\\sin 0)=H(0)=1 \\ne 0$. No.\n- $(0,1)$: $y(0)=1$. For $C_2$, $x(1)=H(\\cos 3\\pi)=H(-1)=1$. So $C_2$ passes through $(1,1)$, not $(0,1)$. No.\n- $(1,0)$: $y(1)=H(\\sin 2\\pi)=H(0)=1 \\ne 0$. No.\n- $(1,1)$: $y(1)=H(\\sin 2\\pi)=H(0)=1$. So $C_1$ passes through $(1,1)$.\n  $x(1)=H(\\cos 3\\pi)=H(-1)=1$. So $C_2$ passes through $(1,1)$.\n  Thus, $(1,1)$ is an intersection point.\n\nLet's check the edges (excluding corners):\n- $x=0, y \\in (0,1)$: $y(0)=1$. So we need to find if $(0,1)$ is a point on $C_2$, which we already found is not.\n- $x=1, y \\in (0,1)$: $y(1)=1$. We need $(1,1)$ on $C_2$, which is true, but this is a corner.\n- $y=0, x \\in (0,1)$: $x(0)=H(\\cos 0)=H(1)=1$. We need $(1,0)$ on $C_1$, which is not true.\n- $y=1, x \\in (0,1)$: $x(1)=H(\\cos 3\\pi)=H(-1)=1$. We need $(1,1)$ on $C_1$, which is true, but this is a corner.\n\nThe 96 intersection points are from pairs of arches. An arch for $C_1$ is on an interval $I_i \\subset (0,1)$. An arch for $C_2$ is on an interval $J_j \\subset (0,1)$. Any intersection $(x,y)$ of these two arches must have $x \\in I_i$ and $y \\in J_j$. Thus $x,y \\in (0,1)$.\nSo the point $(1,1)$ is not among these 96 points.\n\nThe total number of intersections is the sum of intersections from arches and the ones on the boundary.\nTotal intersections = $96 + 1 = 97$.\n\n"

"Let the two given equations be\n(1) $y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))$\n(2) $x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))$\n\nFirst, let's analyze the function composition. Let $h(t) = 4g(f(t))$.\nThe functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are defined as $f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|$ and $g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|$.\nSo, $h(t) = 4g(f(t)) = 4||f(t)| - 1/4| = 4|||t| - 1/2| - 1/4|$.\n\nThe arguments of $h$ in the given equations are $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ and $\\cos(3\\pi y)$, which both take values in $[-1, 1]$. Let's analyze $h(t)$ for $t \\in [-1, 1]$.\nThe function $h(t)$ is an even function since it depends on $|t|$. Let's study it for $t \\in [0, 1]$.\n$h(t) = 4||t - 1/2| - 1/4|$.\n- If $t=0$, $h(0) = 4||-1/2|-1/4| = 4|1/2-1/4| = 1$.\n- If $t=1/4$, $h(1/4) = 4||1/4-1/2|-1/4| = 4|-1/4|-1/4| = 4|1/4-1/4| = 0$.\n- If $t=1/2$, $h(1/2) = 4||1/2-1/2|-1/4| = 4|0-1/4| = 1$.\n- If $t=3/4$, $h(3/4) = 4||3/4-1/2|-1/4| = 4|1/4-1/4| = 0$.\n- If $t=1$, $h(1) = 4||1-1/2|-1/4| = 4|1/2-1/4| = 1$.\n\nThe graph of $h(t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ looks like a \"W\". It consists of four linear segments, connecting the points $(0,1), (1/4,0), (1/2,1), (3/4,0), (1,1)$.\nSince $h(t)$ is even, the graph for $t \\in [-1,1]$ is a double \"W\". It consists of 8 linear segments.\nThe range of $h(t)$ for $t \\in [-1,1]$ is $[0,1]$.\nFrom the given equations, we can see that $x \\in [0,1]$ and $y \\in [0,1]$.\n\nLet's analyze the graphs of the two equations in the unit square $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$.\nEquation (1) is $y = h(\\sin(2\\pi x))$. Let's call its graph $C_1$.\nAs $x$ varies from 0 to 1, $t = \\sin(2\\pi x)$ varies from 0 to 1, then to 0, then to -1, and back to 0.\n- For $x \\in [0, 1/4]$, $t=\\sin(2\\pi x)$ goes from 0 to 1. The graph of $y(x)$ is a \"W\" shape.\n- For $x \\in [1/4, 1/2]$, $t$ goes from 1 to 0. The graph is a reversed \"W\".\n- For $x \\in [1/2, 3/4]$, $t$ goes from 0 to -1. Since $h$ is even, this produces a \"W\" shape.\n- For $x \\in [3/4, 1]$, $t$ goes from -1 to 0. This produces a reversed \"W\".\nSo, the graph $C_1$ is a sequence of 4 \"W\"-like shapes. Each \"W\" consists of 4 monotonic segments. Thus, $C_1$ is composed of $4 \\times 4 = 16$ monotonic segments. The endpoints of these segments lie on the lines $y=0$ and $y=1$.\n\nEquation (2) is $x = h(\\cos(3\\pi y))$. Let's call its graph $C_2$.\nAs $y$ varies from 0 to 1, $v = \\cos(3\\pi y)$ varies from 1 to -1, to 1, and to -1.\n- For $y \\in [0, 1/3]$, $v=\\cos(3\\pi y)$ goes from 1 to -1. This corresponds to $v$ going from 1 to 0 and then 0 to -1. The graph of $x(y)$ is a reversed \"W\" followed by a \"W\". This makes up 2 \"W\"-like shapes.\n- For $y \\in [1/3, 2/3]$, $v$ goes from -1 to 1. This gives another 2 \"W\"-like shapes.\n- For $y \\in [2/3, 1]$, $v$ goes from 1 to -1. This gives another 2 \"W\"-like shapes.\nSo, the graph $C_2$ is a sequence of $3 \\times 2 = 6$ \"W\"-like shapes drawn sideways. Each consists of 4 monotonic segments. Thus, $C_2$ is composed of $6 \\times 4 = 24$ monotonic segments. The endpoints of these segments lie on the lines $x=0$ and $x=1$.\n\nWe need to find the number of intersection points of $C_1$ and $C_2$.\nLet's analyze the structure of the monotonic segments.\nA monotonic segment of $C_1$ connects a point on the line $y=0$ to a point on the line $y=1$, or vice-versa. Let's call such a segment a \"vertical\" segment. There are 16 such segments.\nA monotonic segment of $C_2$ connects a point on the line $x=0$ to a point on the line $x=1$, or vice-versa. Let's call such a segment a \"horizontal\" segment. There are 24 such segments.\n\nLet's consider one vertical segment, $\\gamma_V$, and one horizontal segment, $\\gamma_H$.\n$\\gamma_V$ is the graph of a continuous monotonic function $y=f(x)$ for $x \\in [a,b]$, where $\\{f(a), f(b)\\} = \\{0,1\\}$.\n$\\gamma_H$ is the graph of a continuous monotonic function $x=g(y)$ for $y \\in [c,d]$, where $\\{g(c), g(d)\\} = \\{0,1\\}$.\nThe graph of $\\gamma_V$ is a curve within $[a,b]\\times[0,1]$ that connects the top and bottom boundaries of the rectangle $[a,b]\\times[0,1]$.\nThe graph of $\\gamma_H$ is a curve within $[0,1]\\times[c,d]$ that connects the left and right boundaries of the rectangle $[0,1]\\times[c,d]$.\nInside the unit square $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$, $\\gamma_V$ is a curve connecting one of $y=0, y=1$ to the other. $\\gamma_H$ is a curve connecting one of $x=0, x=1$ to the other.\nBy the Intermediate Value Theorem, these two curves must intersect. Since both functions defining the segments are monotonic, they can intersect at most once. Therefore, each vertical segment of $C_1$ intersects each horizontal segment of $C_2$ exactly once.\n\nThe number of vertical segments for $C_1$ is 16.\nThe number of horizontal segments for $C_2$ is 24.\nThe total number of intersections is the product of the number of segments of each curve.\nTotal intersections = $16 \\times 24$.\n$16 \\times 24 = 16 \\times (20 + 4) = 320 + 64 = 384$.\n\nWe should check if any intersection points are shared at the endpoints of segments. An intersection point at an endpoint would mean that multiple segments pass through it, potentially reducing the total count.\nThe endpoints of the segments of $C_1$ are on the lines $y=0$ and $y=1$.\nThe endpoints of the segments of $C_2$ are on the lines $x=0$ and $x=1$.\nAn intersection point could be an endpoint for segments of both curves if it lies on a corner of the squares formed by $x \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and $y \\in \\{0,1\\}$. These are the corners of the unit square: $(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)$.\nLet's check these points:\n- $(0,0)$: $y=h(\\sin(0))=h(0)=1 \\ne 0$. Not on $C_1$.\n- $(0,1)$: $y=h(\\sin(0))=1$. This point is on $C_1$. For $C_2$, $x=h(\\cos(3\\pi \\cdot 1))=h(-1)=1 \\ne 0$. Not on $C_2$.\n- $(1,0)$: $y=h(\\sin(2\\pi))=h(0)=1 \\ne 0$. Not on $C_1$.\n- $(1,1)$: $y=h(\\sin(2\\pi))=h(0)=1$. This point is on $C_1$. For $C_2$, $x=h(\\cos(3\\pi \\cdot 1))=h(-1)=1$. This point is on $C_2$.\nSo, $(1,1)$ is an intersection point. This point is an endpoint for the last segment of $C_1$ and the last segment of $C_2$.\nThe argument that each pair of segments has a unique intersection still holds. The intersection point for the last segment of $C_1$ and the last segment of $C_2$ is simply at their common endpoint $(1,1)$. This does not reduce the count.\n\nThe total number of intersections is $16 \\times 24 = 384$.\n\n"

A more standard comparison would be $y = T_8(\\tilde{x})$ and $x=T_{12}(\\tilde{y})$ where $T_n$ are Chebyshev polynomials and $\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y}$ are linear transformations of $x,y$.\nThe number of monotonic sections of $y(x)$ is $8 \\times 2 = 16$.\nThe number of monotonic sections of $x(y)$ is $12 \\times 2 = 24$.\nLet's denote the number of V-shapes for $y(x)$ as $N_x=8$ and for $x(y)$ as $N_y=12$.\n\nConsider one vertical V-shape from $C_1$ and one horizontal V-shape from $C_2$.\nA vertical V-shape, say $V_i$, is contained in a vertical strip $[x_i, x_{i+1}]\\times[0,1]$. It consists of two monotonic branches, one descending from $y=1$ to $y=0$, and one ascending from $y=0$ to $y=1$.\nA horizontal V-shape, say $U_j$, is contained in a horizontal strip $[0,1]\\times[y_j, y_{j+1}]$. It consists of two monotonic branches, one where $x$ decreases from $1$ to $0$, and one where $x$ increases from $0$ to $1$.\n\nLet's analyze the intersection of $V_i$ and $U_j$.\nLet the branches of $V_i$ be $L_{i,1}$ (y decreasing) and $L_{i,2}$ (y increasing).\nLet the branches of $U_j$ be $M_{j,1}$ (x decreasing) and $M_{j,2}$ (x increasing).\n- $L_{i,1}$ has $dy/dx < 0$. $M_{j,1}$ has $dx/dy < 0$, so $dy/dx < 0$.\n- $L_{i,1}$ has $dy/dx < 0$. $M_{j,2}$ has $dx/dy > 0$, so $dy/dx > 0$.\n- $L_{i,2}$ has $dy/dx > 0$. $M_{j,1}$ has $dx/dy < 0$, so $dy/dx < 0$.\n- $L_{i,2}$ has $dy/dx > 0$. $M_{j,2}$ has $dx/dy > 0$, so $dy/dx > 0$.\n\nThe branches with slopes of opposite signs are guaranteed to intersect.\n$L_{i,1}$ (negative slope) and $M_{j,2}$ (positive slope) must intersect once.\n$L_{i,2}$ (positive slope) and $M_{j,1}$ (negative slope) must intersect once.\nThis gives 2 intersections for each pair $(V_i, U_j)$.\n\nThe branches with slopes of the same sign ($L_{i,1}$ vs $M_{j,1}$ and $L_{i,2}$ vs $M_{j,2}$) will generally not intersect. For instance, for $L_{i,1}$ and $M_{j,1}$, both curves are going \"down and right\". Unless their relative positions are just right, they won't cross. Given the regular, oscillating nature of the curves, we can assume these intersections don't happen in general.\n\nSo, each of the 8 vertical V-shapes of $C_1$ intersects each of the 12 horizontal V-shapes of $C_2$ in exactly 2 points.\nTotal number of intersections = (Number of V-shapes in $C_1$) $\\times$ (Number of V-shapes in $C_2$) $\\times$ 2.\nNumber of intersections = $8 \\times 12 \\times 2 = 192$.\n\nWe should check if any intersections are on the boundary of the square $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$.\n- $x=0$: $y=H(\\sin(0))=H(0)=1$. So $(0,1)$ is on $C_1$. For $C_2$, $0=H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$. This means $\\cos(3\\pi y) \\in \\{\\pm 1/4, \\pm 3/4\\}$. For $y=1$, $\\cos(3\\pi)=-1$, $H(-1)=1 \\ne 0$. So $(0,1)$ is not on $C_2$.\n- $x=1$: $y=H(\\sin(2\\pi))=H(0)=1$. So $(1,1)$ is on $C_1$. For $C_2$, $1=H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$. This is satisfied for $\\cos(3\\pi y) \\in \\{0, \\pm 1/2, \\pm 1\\}$. For $y=1$, $\\cos(3\\pi)=-1$, $H(-1)=1$. So $(1,1)$ is on $C_2$. This is an intersection point.\n- $y=0$: $0=H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$, so $\\sin(2\\pi x) \\in \\{\\pm 1/4, \\pm 3/4\\}$. For $C_2$, $x=H(\\cos(0))=H(1)=1$. None of the values of $x$ for which $y=0$ is $x=1$. No intersection on $y=0$.\n- $y=1$: $1=H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$, so $\\sin(2\\pi x) \\in \\{0, \\pm 1/2, \\pm 1\\}$. For $C_2$, $x=H(\\cos(3\\pi))=H(-1)=1$. So we need $x=1$. For $x=1$, $\\sin(2\\pi)=0$, which is in the set. So $(1,1)$ is an intersection.\n\nThe point $(1,1)$ is an intersection, and it's a vertex of a V-shape for both curves. The \"2 intersections per V-V pair\" might double count vertices.\nThe peaks of all V-shapes for $C_1$ are on the line $y=1$. The peaks of all V-shapes for $C_2$ are on the line $x=1$.\nThe intersection of these peak-lines is the single point $(1,1)$.\nThe valleys of $C_1$ are on $y=0$, and valleys of $C_2$ are on $x=0$. They don't intersect.\nThe argument of 2 intersections per V-V pair holds for V-shapes in general position.\nThe total number of intersections of $y=\\cos(2\\pi n x)$ and $x=\\cos(2\\pi m y)$ in $[0,1]^2$ is $2nm$.\nOur function $y(x)$ is topologically equivalent to $\\cos(16\\pi x)$ and $x(y)$ to $\\cos(24\\pi y)$.\nSo $n=8, m=12$. The number of intersections is $2 \\times 8 \\times 12 = 192$.\n\n"

Let's study it for $t \\in [0, 1]$.\nFor $t \\in [0, 1]$, $F(t) = 4||t-\\frac{1}{2}|-\\frac{1}{4}|$.\n- If $t \\in [0, 1/2]$, $F(t) = 4|(\\frac{1}{2}-t)-\\frac{1}{4}| = 4|\\frac{1}{4}-t|$.\n  - For $t \\in [0, 1/4]$, $F(t) = 4(\\frac{1}{4}-t) = 1-4t$.\n  - For $t \\in [1/4, 1/2]$, $F(t) = 4(t-\\frac{1}{4}) = 4t-1$.\n- If $t \\in [1/2, 1]$, $F(t) = 4|(t-\\frac{1}{2})-\\frac{1}{4}| = 4|t-\\frac{3}{4}|$.\n  - For $t \\in [1/2, 3/4]$, $F(t) = 4(\\frac{3}{4}-t) = 3-4t$.\n  - For $t \\in [3/4, 1]$, $F(t) = 4(t-\\frac{3}{4}) = 4t-3$.\n\nLet's check the values of $F(t)$ at key points for $t \\in [0,1]$:\n$F(0)=1$, $F(1/4)=0$, $F(1/2)=1$, $F(3/4)=0$, $F(1)=1$.\nThe graph of $F(t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ has a \"W\" shape, connecting the points $(0,1), (1/4,0), (1/2,1), (3/4,0), (1,1)$.\n\nLet $C_1$ be the graph of $y = F(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ and $C_2$ be the graph of $x = F(\\cos(3\\pi y))$. We need to find the number of intersection points of $C_1$ and $C_2$.\nThe domain for both curves is the unit square $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of $C_1: y = F(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ for $x \\in [0,1]$.\nLet $u(x) = |\\sin(2\\pi x)|$. As $x$ goes from $0$ to $1$, $u(x)$ traces two arches: from $x=0$ to $x=1/2$, $u$ goes from $0$ to $1$ and back to $0$. From $x=1/2$ to $x=1$, $u$ does the same.\nThe graph of $F(t)$ for $t: 0 \\to 1 \\to 0$ is a \"W\" shape followed by a reversed \"W\" shape, which we can denote as \"WW\".\nSo, for $x \\in [0, 1/2]$, the graph of $y(x)$ is a \"WW\" shape. For $x \\in [1/2, 1]$, it's another \"WW\" shape.\nThus, $C_1$ has a \"WWWW\" shape. A single \"W\" shape has 2 downward \"V\" shapes. So $C_1$ has $4 \\times 2 = 8$ \"V\" shapes. Let's call these \"mountains\". A mountain is a part of the curve that goes from $y=0$, up to $y=1$, and back down to $y=0$. The valleys (where $y=0$) occur when $F(\\sin(2\\pi x))=0$, which means $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|=1/4$ or $3/4$. Each of these equations has 4 solutions for $x \\in (0,1)$, so there are 8 valleys in total. These 8 valleys define the bases of 8 mountains.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of $C_2: x = F(\\cos(3\\pi y))$ for $y \\in [0,1]$.\nLet $v(y) = |\\cos(3\\pi y)|$. As $y$ goes from $0$ to $1$, $v(y)$ traces three arches. For example, from $y=0$ to $y=1/3$, $v$ goes from $1 \\to 0 \\to 1$.\nEach arch of $v(y)$ corresponds to a \"WW\" shape for the graph of $x(y)$.\nSince there are 3 arches for $v(y)$ in $[0,1]$, the graph of $C_2$ is a \"WWWWWW\" shape.\nThis curve has $6 \\times 2 = 12$ \"V\" shapes oriented horizontally. Let's call these \"canyons\". A canyon is a part of the curve going from $x=0$, right to $x=1$, and back to $x=0$. The x-valleys (where $x=0$) occur when $F(\\cos(3\\pi y))=0$, which means $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|=1/4$ or $3/4$. For $z \\in [0,3\\pi]$, $|\\cos(z)|=c$ (for $c \\in (0,1)$) has 6 solutions. So for each value $1/4, 3/4$, there are 6 solutions for $y$, giving a total of 12 x-valleys. These define the bases of 12 canyons.\n\nWe need to find the number of intersections of $C_1$ (8 mountains) and $C_2$ (12 canyons).\nLet's consider one mountain from $C_1$ and one canyon from $C_2$.\nA mountain, say $M$, is a continuous path from a point $(x_1, 0)$ to a peak $(x_p, 1)$ and back to a point $(x_2, 0)$.\nA canyon, say $N$, is a continuous path from a point $(0, y_1)$ to a peak $(1, y_p)$ and back to a point $(0, y_2)$.\n\nA mountain $M$ consists of two monotonic branches:\n1. $M_L$: from $(x_1, 0)$ to $(x_p, 1)$, $y$ is an increasing function of $x$.\n2. $M_R$: from $(x_p, 1)$ to $(x_2, 0)$, $y$ is a decreasing function of $x$.\n\nA canyon $N$ consists of two monotonic branches:\n1. $N_L$: from $(0, y_1)$ to $(1, y_p)$, $x$ is an increasing function of $y$. (Lower branch in y)\n2. $N_R$: from $(1, y_p)$ to $(0, y_2)$, $x$ is a decreasing function of $y$. (Upper branch in y)\n\nLet's analyze the intersections between the branches of $M$ and $N$.\n- Intersection of $M_L$ and $N_L$: $M_L$ is an increasing function $y=h_1(x)$. $N_L$ is an increasing function $x=k_1(y)$, so $y=k_1^{-1}(x)$ is also increasing. The graph of $h_1$ starts at $(x_1,0)$ and ends at $(x_p,1)$. The graph of $k_1^{-1}$ starts at $(0,y_1)$ and ends at $(1,y_p)$. Since $x_1>0, y_1>0, x_p<1, y_p<1$, we have $h_1(x_1)=0 < k_1^{-1}(x_1)$ and $h_1(x_p)=1 > k_1^{-1}(x_p)$. As both are continuous, they must intersect. A detailed analysis of the concavity of the segments shows they are compositions of linear and trigonometric functions. For instance, a branch could be $y=4\\sin(2\\pi x)-1$. Its inverse is $x = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\arcsin(\\frac{y+1}{4})$. The intersection count for two monotonic, continuous functions is generally one, unless they are tangent or overlap. Given the nature of the functions, we can be confident of a single intersection point.\n- Intersection of $M_L$ and $N_R$: $M_L}$ is increasing ($y=h_1(x)$), $N_R$ corresponds to a decreasing function $y=k_2^{-1}(x)$. An increasing and a decreasing function can intersect at most once. By checking endpoints as above, they must intersect.\n- Intersection of $M_R$ and $N_L$: $M_R}$ is decreasing ($y=h_2(x)$), $N_L$ corresponds to an increasing function $y=k_1^{-1}(x)$. They must intersect.\n- Intersection of $M_R$ and $N_R$: $M_R}$ is decreasing ($y=h_2(x)$), $N_R$ corresponds to a decreasing function $y=k_2^{-1}(x)$. They must intersect.\n\nSo, each mountain-canyon pair intersects at 4 points.\nThere are 8 mountains in $C_1$ and 12 canyons in $C_2$.\nThe mountains are separated by points on the x-axis, and canyons by points on the y-axis. An intersection point $(x,y)$ cannot lie on the axes, because if $y=0$, $x=F(\\cos(0))=1$, but for $y=F(\\sin(2\\pi x))=0$, $x \\neq 1$. Similarly if $x=0$.\nThus, all intersections occur for $x,y \\in (0,1)$.\nThe intersections for different pairs of (mountain, canyon) are distinct. An intersection point lies on exactly one mountain and one canyon.\n\nThe total number of intersections is the product of the number of mountains, the number of canyons, and the number of intersections per pair.\nTotal intersections = (Number of mountains) $\\times$ (Number of canyons) $\\times$ (Intersections per pair)\nTotal intersections = $8 \\times 12 \\times 4 = 384$.\n\nWe should check for intersections on the boundary of the unit square.\nIf $x=1$, $y=F(\\sin(2\\pi))=F(0)=1$. The second equation becomes $1=F(\\cos(3\\pi y))$. This requires $|\\cos(3\\pi y)| \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$. For $y=1$, $|\\cos(3\\pi)|=1$, so $F(1)=1$. Thus $(1,1)$ is a solution.\nIf $y=1$, $x=F(\\cos(3\\pi))=F(-1)=1$. The first equation becomes $1=F(\\sin(2\\pi x))$. This requires $|\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$. For $x=1$, $|\\sin(2\\pi)|=0$, so $F(0)=1$. Thus $(1,1)$ is a solution.\nIf $x=0$, $y=F(0)=1$. The second equation becomes $0=F(\\cos(3\\pi y))$, which requires $|\\cos(3\\pi y)| \\in \\{1/4, 3/4\\}$. But for $y=1$, $|\\cos(3\\pi)|=1$, so $(0,1)$ is not a solution.\nIf $y=0$, $x=F(1)=1$. The first equation becomes $0=F(\\sin(2\\pi x))$, which requires $|\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\in \\{1/4, 3/4\\}$. For $x=1$, $|\\sin(2\\pi)|=0$, so $(1,0)$ is not a solution.\nThe point $(1,1)$ is an endpoint of both curves $C_1$ and $C_2$, but it is not part of any of the \"mountains\" or \"canyons\" which are defined between points on the axes. Our counting method enumerates intersections in the open square $(0,1)^2$. The point $(1,1)$ is on the boundary and needs to be considered separately. However, the branches of the mountains and canyons are defined between valleys, which are not at the boundaries. The logic of 4 intersections per pair holds for these interior features. The total count is robust.\n\nFinal count is $8 \\times 12 \\times 4 = 384$.\n\n"

The function $\\cos(3\\pi H(u))$ completes $1.5$ cycles (e.g. from $\\cos(3\\pi)=-1$ to $\\cos(0)=1$ to $\\cos(3\\pi)=-1$).\nSo, as $H(u)$ completes 4 cycles on $[-1,1]$, $h_2(u)$ completes $4 \\times 1.5 = 6$ full cycles.\n\nWe are counting the intersections of a curve $u=h_1(v)$ that oscillates 8 times horizontally, and a curve $v=h_2(u)$ that oscillates 6 times vertically. A good estimate for the number of intersections is $2 \\times (\\text{num horiz. osc}) \\times (\\text{num vert. osc})$.\nNumber of solutions $(u,v) \\approx 2 \\times 8 \\times 6 = 96$.\nLet's refine this. The number of intersections of $u = \\sin(2\\pi N v)$ and $v = \\cos(2\\pi M u)$ in $[-1,1]^2$ is $4NM$ for large $N,M$. Here $N=8, M=6$. So $4 \\times 8 \\times 6 = 192$.\n\nLet's verify this by counting lobes.\nA lobe is a region between consecutive zeros where the function has a constant sign.\nZeros of $h_1(v)$: $\\sin(2\\pi H(v))=0 \\implies 2\\pi H(v) = k\\pi \\implies H(v)=k/2$.\nSince $H(v) \\in [0,1]$, we need $H(v) \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$.\n$H(v)=0$ for $v \\in \\{\\pm 1/4, \\pm 3/4\\}$ (4 solutions).\n$H(v)=1$ for $v \\in \\{0, \\pm 1/2, \\pm 1\\}$ (5 solutions).\n$H(v)=1/2 \\iff 4|||v|-1/2|-1/4|=1/2 \\iff |||v|-1/2|-1/4|=1/8$.\n$||v|-1/2|=1/4\\pm 1/8 \\in \\{3/8, 1/8\\}$.\n$|v|-1/2 = \\pm 3/8$ or $\\pm 1/8$.\n$|v| = 1/2\\pm 3/8 \\in \\{7/8, 1/8\\}$ or $|v|=1/2\\pm 1/8 \\in \\{5/8, 3/8\\}$.\nAll 4 values are in $(0,1)$, so for each value there are 2 solutions for $v$. This gives $4 \\times 2 = 8$ solutions.\nTotal zeros for $h_1(v)$: $4+5+8=17$. This creates 16 lobes for $u=h_1(v)$.\n\nZeros of $h_2(u)$: $\\cos(3\\pi H(u))=0 \\implies 3\\pi H(u) = k\\pi + \\pi/2 \\implies H(u)=(2k+1)/6$.\nSince $H(u) \\in [0,1]$, we need $H(u) \\in \\{1/6, 1/2, 5/6\\}$.\nFor any $c \\in (0,1)$, $H(u)=c$ has 8 solutions for $u \\in (-1,1)$.\nSo for $H(u)=1/6, 1/2, 5/6$, we have $3 \\times 8 = 24$ solutions.\nThis creates 24 lobes for $v=h_2(u)$.\n\nThe grid of zero-sets of the two functions creates $16 \\times 24$ rectangular regions. In each such region, the graphs of $u=h_1(v)$ and $v=h_2(u)$ form simple arches that typically intersect twice. Let's assume 2 intersections per region. This gives $16 \\times 24 \\times 2 = 768$ intersections.\n\nWe must check for intersections on the boundaries of $[-1,1]^2$ or on the axes $u=0, v=0$.\nAn intersection point $(u_0, v_0)$ has $u_0=h_1(v_0)$ and $v_0=h_2(u_0)$.\nIf $u_0=\\pm 1$, then $h_1(v_0)=\\pm 1 \\implies H(v_0) \\in \\{1/4, 3/4\\}$.\nThen $v_0 = h_2(\\pm 1) = \\cos(3\\pi H(\\pm 1)) = \\cos(3\\pi)=-1$.\nSo we need to check if $H(-1)$ is $1/4$ or $3/4$. $H(-1)=1$. So no solution with $u_0=\\pm 1$.\nIf $v_0=\\pm 1$, then $h_2(u_0)=\\pm 1 \\implies H(u_0) \\in \\{0, 1/3, 2/3, 1\\}$.\nThen $u_0 = h_1(\\pm 1) = \\sin(2\\pi H(\\pm 1)) = \\sin(2\\pi)=0$.\nSo we need to check if $H(0) \\in \\{0, 1/3, 2/3, 1\\}$. $H(0)=1$. This gives a solution.\nLet's check $(u_0,v_0)=(0,-1)$.\n$v_0=-1$: $H(u_0)=1 \\implies u_0 \\in \\{0, \\pm 1/2, \\pm 1\\}$. We need $u_0=0$.\n$u_0=0$: $h_1(v_0)=0 \\implies H(v_0) \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$. We need $v_0=-1$. $H(-1)=1$.\nSo $(u,v)=(0,-1)$ is a solution: $0 = h_1(-1)$ and $-1=h_2(0)$.\n\nThe intersections of the lobes are all transversal and occur in the interior of the quadrants, i.e., for $u\\neq 0, v\\neq 0$. The number of such intersections is $16 \\times 24 \\times 2 = 768$.\nThe point $(0,-1)$ is an intersection but not from these lobe intersections. It's an intersection of a zero set with a boundary.\nThe total number of solutions in the $uv$-plane is 768. Let's check if $(0,-1)$ is already counted.\nThe lobes are regions between zeros. The 768 points are not on the zero axes. The point $(0,-1)$ is on the $u=0$ axis. So it is not counted in the 768.\nWait, my logic for $16 \\times 24 \\times 2$ is heuristic. Let's stick to the $2 \\times N \\times M$ formula, which is also a heuristic but for the total number of solutions.\nNumber of oscillations for $y(x)$ is 8. Number of oscillations for $x(y)$ is 12.\nTotal intersections: $2 \\times 8 \\times 12 = 192$.\nThis is for $(x,y) \\in [0,1]^2$. Let's check this.\nThe number of solutions to $u=h_1(h_2(u))$ is $2 \\times (\\text{osc of } h_1) \\times (\\text{osc of } h_2) = 2 \\times 8 \\times 6 = 96$. This is for $u \\in [-1,1]$.\nLet's check the number of sweeps.\n$h_1(v)$ for $v \\in [-1,1]$ sweeps $[-1,1]$ a total of $8 \\times 4 = 32$ times.\n$h_2(u)$ for $u \\in [-1,1]$ sweeps $[-1,1]$ a total of $8 \\times 2 = 16$ times.\nNumber of oscillations of $h_1(h_2(u))$ is $16 \\times (32/2) = 256$. No, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet's assume the number of intersections of $u=h_1(v)$ and $v=h_2(u)$ is 192.\nLet's check the boundaries again.\nThe point $(0,-1)$ is a solution.\nAre there others? $u=h_1(v)$ intersects $v=1$ when $u=h_1(1)=0$. Point $(0,1)$. Is $(0,1)$ on $v=h_2(u)$? $1=h_2(0)=-1$, no.\n$u=h_1(v)$ intersects $v=-1$ when $u=h_1(-1)=0$. Point $(0,-1)$. Is $(0,-1)$ on $v=h_2(u)$? $-1=h_2(0)=-1$, yes.\n$v=h_2(u)$ intersects $u=1$ when $v=h_2(1)=-1$. Point $(1,-1)$. Is $(1,-1)$ on $u=h_1(v)$? $1=h_1(-1)=0$, no.\n$v=h_2(u)$ intersects $u=-1$ when $v=h_2(-1)=-1$. Point $(-1,-1)$. Is $(-1,-1)$ on $u=h_1(v)$? $-1=h_1(-1)=0$, no.\nSo only one solution $(0,-1)$ is on the boundary of the $uv$-square.\n\nThe 192 solutions are for the system $u=h_1(v), v=h_2(u)$.\nLet's assume these are all solutions. One of them is $(0,-1)$.\nSo there are 191 solutions in $(-1,1)\\times(-1,1)$.\nFor each $(u,v)$ with $u,v \\in (-1,1)$, the number of corresponding $(x,y)$ solutions is found by solving $u=\\sin(2\\pi x)$ and $v=\\cos(3\\pi y)$ for $x,y \\in [0,1]$.\n$\\sin(2\\pi x)=u$ has 2 solutions for $x \\in [0,1]$ if $u \\in (-1,1)$.\n$\\cos(3\\pi y)=v$ has 3 solutions for $y \\in [0,1]$ if $v \\in (-1,1)$.\nSo each interior $uv$-solution gives $2 \\times 3 = 6$ solutions in the $xy$-plane.\nThe boundary solution $(0,-1)$:\n$u=0 \\implies \\sin(2\\pi x)=0 \\implies x \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$ (3 solutions).\n$v=-1 \\implies \\cos(3\\pi y)=-1 \\implies y \\in \\{1/3, 1\\}$ (2 solutions).\nSo the solution $(0,-1)$ corresponds to $3 \\times 2 = 6$ solutions in the $xy$-plane.\n\nTotal number of solutions is $191 \\times 6 + 6 = 192 \\times 6 = 1152$.\nThe formula $2NM$ for $y=\\cos(2\\pi N x), x=\\cos(2\\pi M y)$ gives the number of solutions in $[0,1]^2$.\nOur functions are not pure cosines, but the oscillation counting seems to be the most reasonable approach.\nNumber of \"up-and-down\" oscillations of $y(x)$ on $[0,1]$ is 8.\nNumber of \"left-and-right\" oscillations of $x(y)$ on $[0,1]$ is 12.\nThis gives $2 \\times 8 \\times 12 = 192$ intersections.\n\nLet's double check the number of oscillations of $x(y)$.\n$y \\in [0,1]$, $v=\\cos(3\\pi y)$ goes from $1$ to $-1$ (for $y \\in [0,1/3]$), then $-1$ to $1$ ($y \\in [1/3,2/3]$), then $1$ to $-1$ ($y \\in [2/3,1]$).\nThe graph of $H(v)$ on $[-1,1]$ is a WW-shape, which has 4 minima. This corresponds to 4 oscillations.\nSo as $v$ traverses $[-1,1]$ once, $x(y)$ performs 4 oscillations.\nSince $v$ traverses $[-1,1]$ back and forth 3 times (1.5 cycles for $\\cos(3\\pi y)$), the number of oscillations of $x(y)$ is $3 \\times 4 = 12$.\nThis confirms the number of oscillations for $x(y)$.\nThe number of oscillations for $y(x)$ is $2 \\times 4=8$ as $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ makes one cycle over $[0,1]$ and $H(u)$ for $u \\in [-1,1]$ has 4 oscillations. No, $u$ goes $0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to -1 \\to 0$. This covers $[0,1]$ twice and $[-1,0]$ twice. $H$ on $[0,1]$ is a W (2 osc). So $2 \\times 2 + 2 \\times 2 = 8$.\nThe reasoning holds.\n\nThe number of intersections for two curves oscillating across each other is twice the product of the number of oscillations.\nTotal number of intersections is $2 \\times 8 \\times 12 = 192$.\n\n"

"Let the two given equations be\n(1) $y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))$\n(2) $x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))$\n\nFirst, let's analyze the function composition. Let $h(t) = 4g(f(t))$.\nThe definitions of $f(t)$ and $g(t)$ are $f(t)=||t|-\\frac{1}{2}|$ and $g(t)=||t|-\\frac{1}{4}|$.\nSo, $h(t) = 4g(f(t)) = 4||f(t)|-\\frac{1}{4}|$.\nSince $f(t) = ||t|-\\frac{1}{2}| \\ge 0$, we have $|f(t)|=f(t)$.\nThus, $h(t) = 4|f(t)-\\frac{1}{4}| = 4|||t|-\\frac{1}{2}|-\\frac{1}{4}|$.\n\nThe arguments for $h$ in the given equations are $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ and $\\cos(3\\pi y)$. Let $u = \\sin(2\\pi x)$ and $v = \\cos(3\\pi y)$. The range of both $u$ and $v$ is $[-1, 1]$.\nLet's analyze the function $h(t)$ for $t \\in [-1, 1]$.\nNotice that $h(t)$ depends only on $|t|$, so $h(t)$ is an even function, i.e., $h(t)=h(-t)$.\nLet's study $h(t)$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$. In this case, $|t|=t$.\n$h(t) = 4||t-\\frac{1}{2}|-\\frac{1}{4}|$ for $t \\in [0,1]$.\nLet's analyze this piecewise:\n- If $t \\in [0, 1/2]$, $|t-1/2|=1/2-t$. Then $h(t)=4|\\frac{1}{2}-t-\\frac{1}{4}| = 4|\\frac{1}{4}-t|$.\n    - If $t \\in [0, 1/4]$, $h(t)=4(\\frac{1}{4}-t)=1-4t$.\n    - If $t \\in [1/4, 1/2]$, $h(t)=4(t-\\frac{1}{4})=4t-1$.\n- If $t \\in [1/2, 1]$, $|t-1/2|=t-1/2$. Then $h(t)=4|t-\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{4}| = 4|t-\\frac{3}{4}|$.\n    - If $t \\in [1/2, 3/4]$, $h(t)=4(\\frac{3}{4}-t)=3-4t$.\n    - If $t \\in [3/4, 1]$, $h(t)=4(t-\\frac{3}{4})=4t-3$.\n\nLet's check the values of $h(t)$ at key points for $t \\in [0,1]$:\n$h(0)=1$, $h(1/4)=0$, $h(1/2)=1$, $h(3/4)=0$, $h(1)=1$.\nThe graph of $h(t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ looks like a \"VWV\" shape, oscillating between 0 and 1. It has two \"teeth\" pointing downwards. Since $h(t)$ is even, the graph for $t \\in [-1,1]$ is a \"MWM\" shape, with four teeth.\n\nThe equations are $y = h(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ and $x = h(\\cos(3\\pi y))$.\nFrom the expression for $h(t)$, its range is $[0,1]$. So, $x \\in [0,1]$ and $y \\in [0,1]$. We only need to find solutions in the unit square $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the graph of $y=h(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ for $x \\in [0,1]$.\nLet $u(x) = |\\sin(2\\pi x)|$. As $x$ goes from $0$ to $1/2$, $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ goes from $0$ to $1$ and back to $0$. So $u(x)$ goes from $0$ to $1$ (for $x \\in [0,1/4]$) and then from $1$ to $0$ (for $x \\in [1/4,1/2]$).\nAs $|t|$ goes from $0$ to $1$, $h(t)$ traces the VWV shape (2 teeth). As $|t|$ goes from $1$ to $0$, $h(t)$ traces the same shape in reverse.\nSo, for $x \\in [0, 1/2]$, the graph of $y(x)$ consists of two VWV shapes, which means $2 \\times 2 = 4$ teeth.\nFor $x \\in [1/2, 1]$, the path of $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ is from $0$ to $-1$ to $0$. Since $h$ is even, this produces the same graph as for $x \\in [0,1/2]$.\nSo, the graph of $y(x)$ for $x \\in [0,1]$ is composed of 4 VWV shapes, which results in a total of $4 \\times 2 = 8$ teeth. A \"tooth\" is the part of the graph between two consecutive zeros.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the graph of $x=h(\\cos(3\\pi y))$ for $y \\in [0,1]$.\nLet $v(y) = |\\cos(3\\pi y)|$. As $y$ goes from $0$ to $1$, $\\cos(3\\pi y)$ goes from $1$ to $-1$, then to $1$, then to $-1$. This is $1.5$ cycles.\nThe path of $v(y)=|\\cos(3\\pi y)|$ is $1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1$.\nThe argument of $h$ traverses the interval $[0,1]$ three times back and forth.\nEach traversal from $0$ to $1$ and back to $0$ (e.g., for $y \\in [0,1/3]$ where $\\cos(3\\pi y)$ goes $1 \\to -1$) generates 2 VWV shapes.\nSo, the graph of $x(y)$ for $y \\in [0,1]$ is composed of $3 \\times 2 = 6$ VWV shapes, which results in a total of $6 \\times 2 = 12$ teeth.\n\nWe are looking for the number of intersections of two curves in the unit square:\n1. $C_1: y=h(\\sin(2\\pi x))$, which has 8 teeth pointing downwards, with their bases on the line $y=0$.\n2. $C_2: x=h(\\cos(3\\pi y))$, which has 12 teeth pointing leftwards, with their bases on the line $x=0$.\n\nLet's denote the teeth of $C_1$ by $A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_8$. Each $A_i$ is an arc connecting two points on the x-axis, $(x_i,0)$ and $(x_{i+1},0)$.\nLet's denote the teeth of $C_2$ by $B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_{12}$. Each $B_j$ is an arc connecting two points on the y-axis, $(0,y_j)$ and $(0,y_{j+1})$.\n\nConsider one tooth-arc $A_i$ and one tooth-arc $B_j$.\n$A_i$ is a continuous curve in $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$ with endpoints on the bottom edge of the square.\n$B_j$ is a continuous curve in $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$ with endpoints on the left edge of the square.\nBy a topological argument, a path connecting the left edge to itself and a path connecting the bottom edge to itself must intersect within the square.\nLet's check if they can intersect more than once. The teeth are simple arches, with a single maximum. An arch $y=f(x)$ is first increasing and then decreasing. An arch $x=g(y)$ is first increasing and then decreasing (with respect to its axis). Two such simple arches will intersect at most twice. Given their shapes (emanating from different axes), they are expected to intersect exactly once.\nLet's assume this is the case. Each of the 8 teeth of $C_1$ intersects each of the 12 teeth of $C_2$.\nThis gives $8 \\times 12 = 96$ intersection points.\n\nThese intersections occur where both $x$ and $y$ are not zero. The teeth are defined as the parts of the graph between zeros. So these 96 points are in $(0,1)\\times(0,1)$.\n\nWe should also check for intersections on the boundaries of the unit square or on the lines where the teeth are not defined.\nThe teeth are defined on intervals between the zeros of the functions.\nThe zeros of $y(x)$ are given by $|\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\in \\{1/4, 3/4\\}$.\nThe zeros of $x(y)$ are given by $|\\cos(3\\pi y)| \\in \\{1/4, 3/4\\}$.\nAn intersection point $(x_0, y_0)$ on the boundary of a tooth would mean $y(x_0)=0$ and $x_0=x(y_0)$, or $x(y_0)=0$ and $y_0=y(x_0)$.\nIf $y_0=0$, $x_0=x(0)=h(\\cos(0))=h(1)=1$. So we have the point $(1,0)$.\nFor this to be an intersection, it must lie on $C_1$. $y(1)=h(\\sin(2\\pi))=h(0)=1$. So $y(1)=1 \\ne 0$. Thus, $(1,0)$ is not an intersection point.\nIf $x_0=0$, $y_0=y(0)=h(\\sin(0))=h(0)=1$. So we have the point $(0,1)$.\nFor this to be an intersection, it must lie on $C_2$. $x(1)=h(\\cos(3\\pi))=h(-1)=1$. So $x(1)=1 \\ne 0$. Thus, $(0,1)$ is not an intersection point.\n\nThe analysis of teeth intersections does not cover points where the functions reach their maximum value of 1.\nLet's check for intersections where $x=1$ or $y=1$.\nIf $y=1$: $1 = h(\\sin(2\\pi x))$. This means $|\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$.\nThis gives $x \\in \\{0, 1/12, 1/4, 5/12, 1/2, 7/12, 3/4, 11/12, 1\\}$. There are 9 such values.\nFor an intersection point $(x_0, 1)$, we must have $x_0 = x(1) = h(\\cos(3\\pi)) = h(-1) = 1$.\nOut of the 9 possible values for $x_0$, only $x_0=1$ matches. So $(1,1)$ is an intersection point.\n\nIf $x=1$: $1 = h(\\cos(3\\pi y))$. This means $|\\cos(3\\pi y)| \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$.\nThis gives $y \\in \\{0, 1/9, 1/6, 2/9, 1/3, 4/9, 1/2, 5/9, 2/3, 7/9, 5/6, 8/9, 1\\}$. There are 13 such values.\nFor an intersection point $(1, y_0)$, we must have $y_0 = y(1) = h(\\sin(2\\pi)) = h(0) = 1$.\nOut of the 13 possible values for $y_0$, only $y_0=1$ matches. This again gives the intersection point $(1,1)$.\n\nThe point $(1,1)$ is not counted in the 96 points from the teeth intersections, because the teeth are defined to be strictly between the scaffolding of the VWV-shapes, which are the points where the value is 1. The teeth are the parts of the graph connecting points where the value is 0. The point $(1,1)$ has neither coordinate on a tooth.\n\nSo, we have 96 intersection points from the crossings of the 8 teeth of $C_1$ and the 12 teeth of $C_2$, and one additional intersection point at $(1,1)$.\nThe total number of intersections is $96 + 1 = 97$.\n\nFinal check:\nNumber of downward teeth for $y(x)$: $v=|\\sin(2\\pi x)|$ goes $0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0$ for $x \\in [0,1]$. A $0 \\to 1$ or $1 \\to 0$ sweep for $v$ creates a VWV shape (2 teeth). So $4 \\times 2 = 8$ teeth. Correct.\nNumber of leftward teeth for $x(y)$: $v=|\\cos(3\\pi y)|$ goes $1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1$ for $y \\in [0,1]$. A $0 \\to 1$ or $1 \\to 0$ sweep for $v$ creates a VWV shape (2 teeth). There are 6 such sweeps. So $6 \\times 2 = 12$ teeth. Correct.\nThe argument that each tooth of $y(x)$ must intersect each tooth of $x(y)$ once seems robust due to the simple topology of the curves within the unit square.\n\nTotal intersections = (intersections from teeth) + (other intersections) = $96 + 1 = 97$.\n\n"

"Let the two given equations be\n(1) $y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x)))$\n(2) $x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y)))$\n\nFirst, let's analyze the functions $f(x)=||x|-\\frac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=||x|-\\frac{1}{4}|$.\nLet's define a composite function $H(t) = 4g(f(t))$.\n$f(t) = ||t|-\\frac{1}{2}|$. Since the output of $f(t)$ is always non-negative, the absolute value in $g(f(t))$ is redundant, i.e., $|f(t)|=f(t)$.\nSo, $g(f(t)) = |f(t) - \\frac{1}{4}| = |||t|-\\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4}|$.\nThus, $H(t) = 4|||t|-\\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4}|$.\n\nThe arguments for $H$ in the given equations are $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ and $\\cos(3\\pi y)$, which both take values in $[-1, 1]$. Let's analyze $H(t)$ for $t \\in [-1, 1]$.\n$H(t)$ is an even function since it depends only on $|t|$. Let's analyze it for $t \\in [0, 1]$.\nFor $t \\in [0, 1]$, $H(t) = 4||t-\\frac{1}{2}| - \\frac{1}{4}|$.\n- If $t \\in [0, 1/2]$, $H(t) = 4|\\frac{1}{2}-t - \\frac{1}{4}| = 4|\\frac{1}{4}-t|$.\n  - For $t \\in [0, 1/4]$, $H(t) = 4(\\frac{1}{4}-t) = 1-4t$.\n  - For $t \\in [1/4, 1/2]$, $H(t) = 4(t-\\frac{1}{4}) = 4t-1$.\n- If $t \\in [1/2, 1]$, $H(t) = 4|t-\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}| = 4|t-\\frac{3}{4}|$.\n  - For $t \\in [1/2, 3/4]$, $H(t) = 4(\\frac{3}{4}-t) = 3-4t$.\n  - For $t \\in [3/4, 1]$, $H(t) = 4(t-\\frac{3}{4}) = 4t-3$.\n\nLet's check the values of $H(t)$ at key points in $[0,1]$:\n$H(0)=1$, $H(1/4)=0$, $H(1/2)=1$, $H(3/4)=0$, $H(1)=1$.\nThe graph of $H(t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ consists of four linear segments forming two V-shapes. The range of $H(t)$ for $t \\in [-1,1]$ is $[0,1]$.\n\nThe system of equations can be written as:\n(1) $y = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$\n(2) $x = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$\nFrom the range of $H$, we know that any solution $(x,y)$ must satisfy $x \\in [0,1]$ and $y \\in [0,1]$. So we only need to consider $x,y \\in [0,1]$.\n\nLet's denote the functions on the right hand sides as $y_1(x) = H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ and $x_2(y) = H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$. An intersection is a point $(x,y)$ that satisfies both equations. This is equivalent to finding the number of solutions to the fixed-point equation $x = x_2(y_1(x))$.\nLet $K(x) = x_2(y_1(x)) = H(\\cos(3\\pi H(\\sin(2\\pi x))))$. We need to find the number of solutions to $x=K(x)$ for $x \\in [0,1]$.\n\nLet's analyze the oscillatory behavior of $K(x)$ by counting the number of monotonic pieces of its constituent functions. A function has $N$ monotonic pieces on an interval if the interval can be subdivided into $N$ subintervals on each of which the function is monotonic.\n1. Let $f_1(x) = |\\sin(2\\pi x)|$ for $x \\in [0,1]$. The graph of $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ completes one full cycle. The graph of $|\\sin(2\\pi x)|$ consists of two arches. It is monotonic on $[0, 1/4], [1/4, 1/2], [1/2, 3/4], [3/4, 1]$. So, $f_1(x)$ has $N_1=4$ monotonic pieces. The range on each piece is $[0,1]$ or $[1,0]$.\n2. Let $f_2(t) = H(t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$. As we saw, its graph has two V-shapes. It is monotonic on $[0,1/4], [1/4,1/2], [1/2,3/4], [3/4,1]$. So, $f_2(t)$ has $N_2=4$ monotonic pieces.\n3. The function $y_1(x) = f_2(f_1(x)) = H(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)$. On each monotonic piece of $f_1(x)$, the range is $[0,1]$. The function $f_2$ has 4 monotonic pieces on this range. Thus, the number of monotonic pieces of $y_1(x)$ is $N_{y_1} = N_1 \\times N_2 = 4 \\times 4 = 16$.\n\n4. Let $f_3(y) = |\\cos(3\\pi y)|$ for $y \\in [0,1]$. The graph of $\\cos(3\\pi y)$ completes $1.5$ cycles. The graph of $|\\cos(3\\pi y)|$ consists of three full arches. It is monotonic on $[0, 1/6], [1/6, 1/3], [1/3, 1/2], [1/2, 2/3], [2/3, 5/6], [5/6, 1]$. So, $f_3(y)$ has $N_3=6$ monotonic pieces. The range on each piece is $[0,1]$ or $[1,0]$.\n5. The function $x_2(y) = f_2(f_3(y)) = H(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|)$. Similar to $y_1(x)$, the number of monotonic pieces of $x_2(y)$ is $N_{x_2} = N_3 \\times N_2 = 6 \\times 4 = 24$.\n\nNow, we analyze $K(x) = x_2(y_1(x))$. The function $y_1(x)$ has 16 monotonic pieces on $[0,1]$. On each such piece, say $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$, the range of $y_1(x)$ is $[0,1]$ or $[1,0]$. The function $x_2(y)$ has 24 monotonic pieces on $[0,1]$. Therefore, for each monotonic piece of $y_1(x)$, $K(x)$ will have 24 monotonic pieces.\nThe total number of monotonic pieces of $K(x)$ on $[0,1]$ is $N_K = N_{y_1} \\times N_{x_2} = 16 \\times 24 = 384$.\n\nLet's find the values of $K(x)$ at the endpoints and at its turning points.\n$K(0) = H(\\cos(3\\pi H(\\sin(0)))) = H(\\cos(3\\pi H(0))) = H(\\cos(3\\pi \\cdot 1)) = H(-1) = H(1) = 1$.\n$K(1) = H(\\cos(3\\pi H(\\sin(2\\pi)))) = H(\\cos(3\\pi H(0))) = H(\\cos(3\\pi)) = H(-1) = 1$.\nSo the graph of $y=K(x)$ starts at $(0,1)$ and ends at $(1,1)$.\n\nThe turning points of $K(x)$ occur when the function changes its direction of monotonicity. These points are where $K(x)$ reaches a local maximum or minimum. Let's find the values of $K(x)$ at these points. A turning point of $K(x)=x_2(y_1(x))$ occurs when $y_1(x)$ is a turning point for $x_2$ or when $y_1$ itself has a turning point.\nThe turning points of $H(t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ are at $t \\in \\{0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1\\}$. The values of $H$ at these points are either 0 or 1.\nThe turning points of $y_1(x)$ occur when $|\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\in \\{0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1\\}$. At these points, $y_1(x)$ is either 0 or 1.\nThe turning points of $x_2(y)$ occur when $|\\cos(3\\pi y)| \\in \\{0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1\\}$. At these points, $x_2(y)$ is either 0 or 1.\nThe value of $K(x)$ at any of its turning points will be $x_2(y_1(x))$, where $y_1(x)$ would be a value at which $x_2$ has a turning point, or $y_1(x)$ itself is at a turning point value (0 or 1).\nIf $y_1(x) = 0$, $K(x) = x_2(0) = H(1) = 1$.\nIf $y_1(x) = 1$, $K(x) = x_2(1) = H(1) = 1$.\nIf $y_1(x)$ is a value $y_c$ where $x_2$ has a turning point, $x_2(y_c)$ is 0 or 1.\nSo, at any turning point, the value of $K(x)$ is either 0 or 1.\n\nThe graph of $K(x)$ for $x \\in [0,1]$ starts at $y=1$, ends at $y=1$, and oscillates between 0 and 1. Since $K(x)$ has 384 monotonic pieces, it has 383 turning points in $(0,1)$. The values at these turning points must alternate between 0 and 1.\nLet $0=t_0 < t_1 < \\dots < t_{383} < t_{384}=1$ be the $x$-coordinates of the start, turning points, and end.\n$K(t_0)=K(0)=1$.\n$K(t_1)=0$.\n$K(t_2)=1$.\n...\n$K(t_{383})=0$.\n$K(t_{384})=K(1)=1$.\n\nWe are looking for the number of solutions to $K(x)=x$.\nLet's analyze the function $f(x) = K(x)-x$.\n- At $x=0$: $f(0) = K(0)-0 = 1 > 0$.\n- At $x=t_1$: $f(t_1) = K(t_1)-t_1 = 0-t_1 < 0$. Since $f$ is continuous, there is at least one root in $(0, t_1)$.\n- At $x=t_2$: $f(t_2) = K(t_2)-t_2 = 1-t_2 > 0$. There is at least one root in $(t_1, t_2)$.\n- ...\n- At $x=t_{383}$: $f(t_{383}) = K(t_{383})-t_{383} = 0-t_{383} < 0$. There is at least one root in $(t_{382}, t_{383})$.\nThis gives 383 roots in $(0, t_{383})$.\n- For the last interval $[t_{383}, 1]$:\n$f(t_{383}) = -t_{383} < 0$.\n$f(1) = K(1)-1 = 1-1 = 0$. So $x=1$ is a solution.\nThe derivative of $K(x)$ involves products of derivatives of $H$, sin, and cos. The derivative of $H(t)$ is $\\pm 4$ where it exists. The derivatives of $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ and $\\cos(3\\pi y)$ can be up to $2\\pi$ and $3\\pi$ in magnitude. The slope of $K(x)$ can be very large, much larger than the slope of $y=x$ (which is 1). This suggests that each monotonic piece of $K(x)$ will cross the line $y=x$ at most once.\n\nLet's count the intersections based on this assumption.\nThe graph of $K(x)$ consists of 384 monotonic segments.\nThe segment from $(t_{i-1}, K(t_{i-1}))$ to $(t_i, K(t_i))$ intersects $y=x$ if $K(t_{i-1})-t_{i-1}$ and $K(t_i)-t_i$ have opposite signs.\nFor $i=1, \\dots, 383$:\n$K(t_{i-1})-t_{i-1}$ is either $1-t_{i-1}>0$ or $-t_{i-1}<0$.\n$K(t_i)-t_i$ is either $-t_i<0$ or $1-t_i>0$.\nThe values $K(t_i)$ alternate $1,0,1,0,\\dots$. So the signs of $K(t_i)-t_i$ alternate between positive and negative.\nThus, for each of the 383 intervals $(t_0, t_1), (t_1, t_2), \\dots, (t_{382}, t_{383})$, there is one intersection. This gives 383 intersections.\nNow consider the last interval $(t_{383}, 1)$. The segment connects $(t_{383}, 0)$ and $(1,1)$.\nThe line segment is $y = \\frac{1-0}{1-t_{383}}(x-t_{383})$. We set $y=x$:\n$x = \\frac{x-t_{383}}{1-t_{383}} \\implies x(1-t_{383}) = x-t_{383} \\implies x-xt_{383} = x-t_{383} \\implies xt_{383}=t_{383}$.\nSince $t_{383} \\neq 0$, we have $x=1$.\nSo this last segment intersects $y=x$ only at its endpoint $x=1$.\nThis gives one more intersection.\nThe total number of intersections is $383 + 1 = 384$.\n\nLet's double check this using oscillations. The graph of $K(x)$ has $384/2 = 192$ \"V-shapes\" (or oscillations).\nLet's consider one such oscillation on an interval $[a,b]$, where $K(a)=1$ and $K(b)=1$.\nThe line $y=x$ goes from $(a,a)$ to $(b,b)$.\nFor $x \\in (0,1)$, $x<1$. So $K(a)=1>a$ and $K(b)=1>b$.\nThe graph of $K(x)$ starts above $y=x$ and ends above $y=x$.\nIn between, it goes down to a minimum value of 0 at some point $c \\in (a,b)$.\nAt $x=c$, $K(c)=0<c$.\nSince $K(a)>a$ and $K(c)<c$, there must be an intersection in $(a,c)$.\nSince $K(c)<c$ and $K(b)>b$, there must be an intersection in $(c,b)$.\nSo each of these oscillations accounts for 2 intersections.\nThere are 192 such oscillations. Do they all lie strictly within $(0,1)$?\nThe turning points $t_i$ are in $(0,1)$. The endpoints are $0$ and $1$.\nThe oscillations are between turning points. So they are in $(0,1)$.\nThe last turning point is $t_{383}$. The last oscillation is on $[t_{382}, t_{384}=1]$? No.\nThe oscillations are on $[t_{2k}, t_{2k+2}]$.\nThe graph of $K(x)$ starts at $(0,1)$ and ends at $(1,1)$. The minima are all at $y=0$, maxima at $y=1$.\nThere are 192 minima at $y=0$. Let their x-coordinates be $c_1, \\dots, c_{192}$.\n$K(0)=1>0$. $K(c_1)=0<c_1$. So there is a root in $(0,c_1)$.\nBetween two minima $c_k, c_{k+1}$, there is a maximum at some $m_k$, where $K(m_k)=1$.\n$K(c_k)=0<c_k$. $K(m_k)=1>m_k$. Root in $(c_k, m_k)$.\n$K(m_k)=1>m_k$. $K(c_{k+1})=0<c_{k+1}$. Root in $(m_k, c_{k+1})$.\nThis gives $1 + 2 \\times 191 + 1 = 384$?\nLet's count pairs of roots.\nFor each of the 192 minima $c_k$, we have $K(c_k)-c_k < 0$.\nFor each of the 191 maxima $m_k$ in $(0,1)$, we have $K(m_k)-m_k > 0$.\nAlso $K(0)-0>0$ and $K(1)-1=0$.\nThe sequence of signs of $f(x)=K(x)-x$ at $0, c_1, m_1, c_2, \\dots, m_{191}, c_{192}, 1$ is\n$+, -, +, -, \\dots, +, -, 0$.\nThere are $1+191 \\times 2 + 1 = 384$ sign changes or zeros.\n$f(0)>0, f(c_1)<0$: one root.\n$f(c_k)<0, f(m_k)>0$: one root for each $k=1,..,191$. (191 roots)\n$f(m_k)>0, f(c_{k+1})<0$: one root for each $k=1,..,191$. (191 roots)\n$f(c_{192})<0, f(1)=0$: one root in $(c_{192}, 1)$ because $f(1-\\epsilon)>0$ as $f'(1)=K'(1)-1=-1$. And $x=1$ is a root.\nLet's re-examine $f'(1)$. $K'(x) = 96\\pi^2 |\\sin(3\\pi y_1(x)) \\cos(2\\pi x)|$. At $x=1$, $y_1(1)=1$, $\\sin(3\\pi)=0$, so $K'(1)=0$. $f'(1)=-1$.\n$f(1)=0$ and $f'(1)<0$ implies $f(1-\\epsilon)>0$ for small $\\epsilon>0$.\n$f(c_{192})<0$. So there is a root in $(c_{192}, 1)$. And $x=1$ is another root.\nSo the last minimum gives two roots.\nTotal number of roots: $1 + 191 \\times 2 + 2 = 1+382+2=385$.\nWait, $f(0)>0, f(c_1)<0$ gives one root.\n$f(c_1)<0, f(m_1)>0$ gives another.\n$f(m_1)>0, f(c_2)<0$ gives another.\n...\n$f(m_{191})>0, f(c_{192})<0$ gives another.\nThis is $1+191+191=383$ roots in $(0, c_{192})$.\nThen we analyze $[c_{192}, 1]$. $f(c_{192})<0$, $f(1)=0$, and $f(1-\\epsilon)>0$.\nThis implies there is a root in $(c_{192}, 1)$, and $x=1$ is a root. So 2 roots.\nTotal is $383+2=385$.\n\nLet's re-check the number of intersections of $y=y_1(x)$ and $x=x_2(y)$.\n$y_1(x)$ has 8 arches. $x_2(y)$ has 12 arches.\nEach arch of $y_1(x)$ goes from $y=0$ to $y=1$ and back to $y=0$.\nEach arch of $x_2(y)$ goes from $x=0$ to $x=1$ and back to $x=0$.\nLet's consider one arch of $y_1(x)$. As $x$ traverses the domain of this arch, $y_1(x)$ goes from 0 to 1 and back to 0.\nIn this process, how many times does $x=x_2(y_1(x))$ hold?\nThis is asking for the number of solutions to $x=x_2(y)$ for $y \\in [0,1]$ for a given $x$.\nThis is not the way.\nThe fixed point argument seems the most solid. The number of monotonic pieces is 384. This means 192 oscillations.\n$K(0)=1, K(1)=1$.\nEach oscillation from $y=1$ to $y=0$ and back to $y=1$ over an interval $(a,b) \\subset (0,1)$ contributes two solutions, as $K(a)=1>a, K(b)=1>b$ and $K(c)=0<c$ for some $c \\in (a,b)$.\nThere are 192 such oscillations.\nThe question is whether the endpoints of these oscillation intervals are inside $(0,1)$.\nThe turning points are where $K(x)$ is 0 or 1. These are $t_1, \\dots, t_{383} \\in (0,1)$.\nThe oscillations are on intervals $(t_{2k-2}, t_{2k})$.\nThere are $384/2=192$ oscillations.\n$192 \\times 2 = 384$.\nThis counts solutions in $(0,1)$.\nAt $x=1$, $K(1)=1$, so $x=1$ is a solution.\nAt $x=0$, $K(0)=1 \\ne 0$, not a solution.\nSo total is $384+1=385$.\nThis seems correct. The argument about $f'(1)$ giving an extra solution seems to indicate that the linear segment approximation is not accurate enough near the endpoint.\n$f(c_{192}) < 0$ and $f(1)=0$. $K(x)$ increases from $K(c_{192})=0$ to $K(1)=1$.\n$f'(x)=K'(x)-1$. $f'(1)=-1$. $f'(c_{192})=-1$.\nSince $f(c_{192})<0$ and $f(1)=0$ and $f'(1)<0$, there must be a local maximum in $(c_{192},1)$. For $f$ to have a maximum, $f'(x)=0$, so $K'(x)=1$. This is possible.\nIf there is a local max, say at $x_m$, then $f(x_m)>0$.\n$f(c_{192})<0, f(x_m)>0 \\implies$ root.\n$f(x_m)>0, f(1)=0 \\implies$ no guaranteed root without more info. But since $f(1)=0$ and the function arrives from above, it is just one root.\nWait, $f(x_m)>0$ and $f(1)=0$ with $f'(1)<0$. This means there must be another root between $x_m$ and 1.\nSo two roots on $[c_{192}, 1]$.\nTotal: $383+2=385$.\n\nFinal check: $N_{y_1} = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$ V-shapes, so 16 monotonic segments.\n$N_{x_2} = 3 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 12$ V-shapes, so 24 monotonic segments.\n$N_K = 16 \\times 24 = 384$.\nNumber of solutions is $N_K+1 = 385$? No, it's $N_K$.\nLet's use the $16 \\times 24$ grid argument. It gives 384 intersections.\nThis is from the number of times $y_1(x)=c$ and $x_2(y)=d$ have solutions.\nThis method counts intersections in the open square $(0,1)^2$.\nLet's check the boundaries.\n$x=0$: $y=H(0)=1$. $0=H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$ has 12 solutions for $y$. No intersection.\n$x=1$: $y=H(0)=1$. $1=H(\\cos(3\\pi y))$ has 13 solutions for $y$, one of which is $y=1$. So $(1,1)$ is an intersection.\n$y=0$: $x=H(1)=1$. $0=H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ has 8 solutions for $x$. No intersection.\n$y=1$: $x=H(1)=1$. $1=H(\\sin(2\\pi x))$ has 9 solutions for $x$, one of which is $x=1$. So $(1,1)$ is an intersection.\nThe number of intersections in $(0,1)^2$ is $16 \\times 24 = 384$.\nThis is a known result for these types of curves, number of intersections is $N_x N_y$ where $N_x$ is number of solutions to $y_1(x)=c$ and $N_y$ is number of solutions to $x_2(y)=d$.\nHere $y_1(x)=c$ has 16 solutions for $c \\in (0,1)$. $x_2(y)=d$ has 24 solutions for $d \\in (0,1)$.\nSo $16 \\times 24 = 384$ solutions in $(0,1)^2$.\nAdding the solution $(1,1)$, we get $384+1=385$.\n\nFinal answer seems to be 385.\n\n"

This gives $v=\\frac{3}{4}$ or $v=\\frac{1}{4}$.\n- $h(v)=1$ when $||v-\\frac{1}{2}|-\\frac{1}{4}|=\\frac{1}{4}$. This means $|v-\\frac{1}{2}|-\\frac{1}{4} = \\pm\\frac{1}{4}$.\n  - $|v-\\frac{1}{2}|=\\frac{1}{2} \\implies v-\\frac{1}{2}=\\pm\\frac{1}{2} \\implies v=1$ or $v=0$.\n  - $|v-\\frac{1}{2}|=0 \\implies v=\\frac{1}{2}$.\nSo $h(v)=1$ for $v \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$.\nThe graph of $h(v)$ on $[0,1]$ is a \"W\" shape, with peaks of 1 at $v=0, 1/2, 1$ and valleys of 0 at $v=1/4, 3/4$.\nThe graph of $h(v)$ for $v \\in [0,1]$ consists of 4 monotonic segments:\n- On $[0, 1/4]$, $h(v)$ decreases from 1 to 0.\n- On $[1/4, 1/2]$, $h(v)$ increases from 0 to 1.\n- On $[1/2, 3/4]$, $h(v)$ decreases from 1 to 0.\n- On $[3/4, 1]$, $h(v)$ increases from 0 to 1.\n\nLet $F(x) = h(|\\sin(2\\pi x)|)$ and $G(y) = h(|\\cos(3\\pi y)|)$. We want to find the number of intersections of $y=F(x)$ and $x=G(y)$. This is equivalent to finding the number of solutions to the system, which is also the number of fixed points of the function $\\Phi(x) = G(F(x))$. If $x_0$ is a fixed point, $x_0 = G(F(x_0))$, we can set $y_0 = F(x_0)$, and then $x_0 = G(y_0)$, so $(x_0, y_0)$ is an intersection point. This correspondence is one-to-one. So we count the number of solutions to $x=\\Phi(x)$ for $x \\in [0,1]$.\n\nLet's analyze the number of monotonic segments (arches) of the graphs of $F(x)$ and $G(y)$.\nFor $y=F(x)$:\nLet $v(x) = |\\sin(2\\pi x)|$. The period of $v(x)$ is $1/2$, so there are 2 full cycles in $[0,1]$.\nIn one half-cycle of $v(x)$, e.g., for $x \\in [0, 1/4]$, $v$ goes from 0 to 1. As $v$ goes from 0 to 1, $h(v)$ traverses its 4 monotonic segments. So $F(x)$ has 4 monotonic segments on $[0,1/4]$.\nThe function $v(x)$ has 4 half-cycles on $[0,1]$ (on $[0,1/4], [1/4,1/2], [1/2,3/4], [3/4,1]$).\nSo, the graph of $y=F(x)$ on $[0,1]$ consists of $4 \\times 4 = 16$ monotonic segments, which we call \"vertical arches\".\n\nFor $x=G(y)$:\nLet $w(y) = |\\cos(3\\pi y)|$. The period of $w(y)$ is $1/3$, so there are 3 full cycles in $[0,1]$.\nIn one half-cycle of $w(y)$, e.g., for $y \\in [0, 1/6]$, $w$ goes from 1 to 0. As $w$ goes from 1 to 0, $h(w)$ traverses its 4 monotonic segments (in reverse). So $G(y)$ has 4 monotonic segments on $[0,1/6]$.\nThe function $w(y)$ has 6 half-cycles on $[0,1]$ (on intervals of length $1/6$).\nSo, the graph of $x=G(y)$ on $[0,1]$ consists of $6 \\times 4 = 24$ monotonic segments, \"horizontal arches\".\n\nLet's count the solutions of $x=\\Phi(x) = G(F(x))$.\nThe domain $[0,1]$ for $x$ is divided into 16 intervals, $I_k = [e_{k-1}, e_k]$ for $k=1, \\dots, 16$, on which $F(x)$ is monotonic. The endpoints $e_k$ are the values of $x$ where $F(x)$ has a local extremum (0 or 1). These are the $x$-values where $|\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\in \\{0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1\\}$.\nOn each interval $I_k$, $F(x)$ is a bijection from $I_k$ to $[0,1]$.\nConsequently, the graph of $\\Phi(x)=G(F(x))$ on $I_k$ is a scaled (and possibly flipped) version of the graph of $G(y)$ on $[0,1]$.\nThe graph of $G(y)$ on $[0,1]$ has 24 monotonic segments. So, on each $I_k$, $\\Phi(x)$ also has 24 monotonic segments.\n\nLet's analyze the equation $x=\\Phi(x)$ on one such interval $I_k=[a,b]$.\nThe endpoints $a,b$ are such that $F(a), F(b) \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\nSince $G(0)=h(1)=1$ and $G(1)=h(1)=1$, we have $\\Phi(a)=1$ and $\\Phi(b)=1$.\nLet $\\Psi(x) = \\Phi(x)-x$. We want to count the zeros of $\\Psi(x)$.\nThe graph of $\\Phi(x)$ on $[a,b]$ oscillates between 0 and 1. It has local minima equal to 0 and local maxima equal to 1.\nLet $z$ be a point in $(a,b)$ where $\\Phi(x)$ has a local minimum. Then $\\Phi(z)=0$, so $\\Psi(z) = -z < 0$.\nLet $z'$ be a point in $(a,b)$ where $\\Phi(x)$ has a local maximum. Then $\\Phi(z')=1$, so $\\Psi(z') = 1-z' > 0$.\nThe graph of $G(y)$ on $[0,1]$ has 13 maxima (at $y$-values where $w \\in \\{0,1/2,1\\}$) and 12 minima (where $w \\in \\{1/4,3/4\\}$).\nSo on $[a,b]$, $\\Phi(x)$ has 13 maxima (including endpoints) and 12 minima. This means there are 24 monotonic segments.\n\nConsider any interval $I_k=[a,b]$ with $b<1$.\n$\\Psi(a) = \\Phi(a)-a = 1-a > 0$.\n$\\Psi(b) = \\Phi(b)-b = 1-b > 0$.\nThe function $\\Phi(x)$ on $[a,b]$ has 12 local minima (value 0) and 11 intermediate local maxima (value 1).\nLet the $x$-values of these extrema be $z_1, \\dots, z_{23}$ in $(a,b)$.\n$\\Psi(a)>0$. At a minimum $z_j$, $\\Psi(z_j)<0$. At a maximum $z_l$, $\\Psi(z_l)>0$.\nThe sequence of signs of $\\Psi$ at $a, z_1, z_2, \\dots, z_{23}, b$ is $+,-,+,\\dots,-,+$.\nThere are 24 sign changes, implying at least one root in each subinterval. By monotonicity in each subinterval, there is exactly one root. So there are 24 solutions in $(a,b)$.\nThis applies to the first 15 intervals $I_1, \\dots, I_{15}$, since their endpoints are all less than 1.\nNumber of solutions in these 15 intervals = $15 \\times 24 = 360$.\n\nNow consider the last interval, $I_{16}=[a,1]$. Here $b=1$.\n$\\Psi(a) = 1-a > 0$.\n$\\Psi(1) = \\Phi(1)-1 = G(F(1))-1$.\n$F(1) = h(|\\sin(2\\pi)|) = h(0) = 1$.\n$G(1) = h(|\\cos(3\\pi)|) = h(1) = 1$.\nSo $\\Phi(1)=1$, and $\\Psi(1)=0$. Thus $x=1$ is a solution.\nLet's analyze the roots in $I_{16}$. The extrema of $\\Phi(x)$ are at $z_1, \\dots, z_{23}$ in $(a,1)$.\nThe sequence of signs of $\\Psi$ at $a, z_1, \\dots, z_{23}, 1$ is $+,-,+,\\dots,-,0$.\nFrom $a$ to $z_{23}$, there are 23 sign changes, which gives 23 roots in $(a, z_{23})$.\nNow consider the last segment $[z_{23}, 1]$. $\\Phi(z_{23})=0$ is a minimum.\n$\\Psi(z_{23}) = -z_{23} < 0$. $\\Psi(1)=0$.\nTo see if there are roots in $(z_{23}, 1)$, we check the derivative $\\Psi'(1) = \\Phi'(1)-1$.\n$\\Phi'(x) = G'(F(x))F'(x)$.\nNear $x=1^{-}$, $\\sin(2\\pi x) \\approx -2\\pi(x-1)$, so $|\\sin(2\\pi x)| \\approx 2\\pi(x-1)$. Let this be $v$.\n$F(x)=h(v) = 4(1/4-v) = 1-4v = 1-8\\pi(x-1)$. So $F'(1)=-8\\pi$.\nNear $y=1^{-}$, $\\cos(3\\pi y) \\approx -1$. Let $y=1-\\epsilon$. $\\cos(3\\pi(1-\\epsilon))=\\cos(3\\pi-3\\pi\\epsilon)=-\\cos(3\\pi\\epsilon)\\approx-1+(3\\pi\\epsilon)^2/2$.\n$w=|\\cos(3\\pi y)| \\approx 1-(3\\pi\\epsilon)^2/2$.\n$G(y)=h(w)=4(w-3/4)=4w-3 \\approx 4(1-(3\\pi\\epsilon)^2/2)-3=1-18\\pi^2\\epsilon^2 = 1-18\\pi^2(1-y)^2$.\n$G'(y) = 36\\pi^2(1-y)$. So $G'(1)=0$.\nTherefore, $\\Phi'(1) = G'(F(1))F'(1) = G'(1)F'(1) = 0 \\cdot (-8\\pi) = 0$.\n$\\Psi'(1) = 0-1 = -1$.\nSince $\\Psi(1)=0$ and $\\Psi'(1)=-1$, the graph of $\\Psi(x)$ is decreasing as it passes through $(1,0)$. So, for $x$ slightly less than 1, $\\Psi(x)>0$.\nSince $\\Psi(z_{23})<0$ and $\\Psi(x)>0$ for $x \\to 1^-$, there must be at least one root in $(z_{23}, 1)$. Assuming well-behaved functions, we have exactly one root.\nSo, in $I_{16}$, we have 23 roots in $(a, z_{23})$, 1 root in $(z_{23}, 1)$, and the root $x=1$.\nTotal solutions in $I_{16}$ is $23+1+1=25$.\n\nTotal number of intersections = (solutions in $I_1, \\dots, I_{15}$) + (solutions in $I_{16}$)\nTotal = $15 \\times 24 + 25 = 360 + 25 = 385$.\n\nFinal check: The endpoints of the 16 intervals $I_k$ are not solutions, except for $x=1$. The solutions found in the interior of each interval are distinct from each other and from the endpoints. The counting is consistent.\n\n"

We want to find the number of intersections of $y=F(x)$ and $x=G(y)$. This is equivalent to finding the number of solutions to the system, which is also the number of fixed points of the function $\\Phi(x) = G(F(x))$. If $x_0$ is a fixed point, $x_0 = G(F(x_0))$, we can set $y_0 = F(x_0)$, and then $x_0 = G(y_0)$, so $(x_0, y_0)$ is an intersection point. This correspondence is one-to-one. So we count the number of solutions to $x=\\Phi(x)$ for $x \\in [0,1]$.\n\nLet's analyze the number of monotonic segments (arches) of the graphs of $F(x)$ and $G(y)$.\nFor $y=F(x)$:\nLet $v(x) = |\\sin(2\\pi x)|$. The period of $v(x)$ is $1/2$, so there are 2 full cycles in $[0,1]$.\nIn one half-cycle of $v(x)$, e.g., for $x \\in [0, 1/4]$, $v$ goes from 0 to 1.

The endpoints $e_k$ are the values of $x$ where $F(x)$ has a local extremum (0 or 1).

Let this be $v$.\n$F(x)=h(v) = 4(1/4-v) = 1-4v = 1-8\\pi(x-1)$. So $F'(1)=-8\\pi$.\nNear $y=1^{-}$, $\\cos(3\\pi y) \\approx -1$.
